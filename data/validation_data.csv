interfaces apps like a source sheet builder and infrastructure like an API and a structured dataset for Jewish texts and textual learning Our website is up at wwwsefariaorgYou can find outputs of our entire database in Sefaria-Exporthttps://githubcom/Sefaria/Sefaria-ExportInterested developers should join the sefara-dev mailing listhttps://groupsgooglecom/forum/forum/sefaria-devFor general discussion about the project please post to the Sefaria Forumhttps://groupsgooglecom/forum/fromgroupsforum/sefariaYou can post bugs or request/discuss features on GitHub Issueshttps://githubcom/blockspeiser/Sefaria-Project/issuesdirectiondescpage1sortcreatedstateopen Tackling an issue marked as a Starter Project is a good way to sink your teeth into SefariaIf youre interested in working on a project you see listed here please email the sefara-dev mailing listhttps://groupsgooglecom/forum/forum/sefaria-dev Getting Started Install PythonMost UNIX systems come with a python interpreter pre-installed  For Windows:Go to the Python Download Pagehttps://wwwpythonorg/download/releases/276 and download and install pythonAdd the python directory to your OS PATH variable See herehttps://docspythonorg/2/using/windowshtml Optional Install virtualenv:If you work on many Python projects you may want to keep Sefarias python installation separate using Virtualenv  If youre happy having Sefaria requirements in your main Python installation skip this stepInstall virtualenvhttp://pypipythonorg/pypi/virtualenv then enter these commands:    virtualenv venv --distribute    source venv/bin/activateNow you should see venv in front of your command prompt The second command sets your shell to use the Python virtual environment that youve just created This is something that you have to run everytime you open a new shell and want to run the Sefaria demo You can always tell if youre in the virtual environment by checking if venv is at the beginning of your command prompt      Pip: If you dont already have it in your Python installation install piphttp://wwwpip-installerorg/en/latest/installinghtml Then use it to install the required Python packagespip install -r requirementstxtIf you are not using virtualenv run it with sudo: sudo pip install -r requirementstxtIf you see an error about a missing pythonh file youll need to install the Python development libraries On Debian systems:     sudo apt-get install python-devOn Fedora systems:    sudo yum install python-develAfter installing the Python development libraries run pip install -r requirementstxt againOn Windows systems use instructions herehttp://wwwtylerbutlercom/2012/05/how-to-install-python-pip-and-virtualenv-on-windows-with-powershell/ and then make sure that the scripts sub folder of the python installation directory is also in PATH Create a local settings file:    cd sefaria    cp localsettingsexamplepy localsettingspy    vim localsettingspy    Replace the placeholder values with values with those matching your environment You can name your local database sefaria will be the default created by mongorestore below You can leave SEFARIADBUSER ad SEFARIADBPASSWORD blank if you dont need to run authentication on Mongo Create a log directory:Create a directory called log under the project folder Make sure that the server user has write access to it by using a command such as chmod 777 Get Mongo running:If you dont already have it install MongoDBhttp://docsmongodborg/manual/installation/ Our current data dump requires MongoDB version 26 or later After installing Mongo run the mongo daemon with:    sudo mongod Put some texts in your database:A MongoDB dump of our database is available at http://devsefariaorg/static/dumptargz  Download and unzip this content then from the parent directory which contains dump run:    mongorestore --dropThis will create or overwrite a mongo database called sefaria Set up Djangos local servermanagepy is used to run and to manage the local server  Is is located in the root directory of the Sefaria-Project code base Django auth features run on a separate database To init this database and set up Djangos auth system switch to the root directory of the Sefaria-Project code base and run:     python managepy syncdb     Run the development server:    python managepy runserverYou can also make it publicly available by specifying 0000 for the host:    python managepy runserver 0000:8000 Optional Get Node running for server side renderingSefaria uses Reactjs To render HTML server-side we use a Nodejs server For development the site is fully functional without server side rendering For deploying in a production environemnet however server side HTML is very important for bots and SEO To install node and npm see herehttps://nodejsorg/en/download/ On Debian systems you can do:    sudo apt-get install nodejs    sudo apt-get install npmNow download the required Javascript libraries and install some global tools for development with the setup script    npm install    sudo npm run setupCreate a local settings file for node and tell it what port to run on and where to find the Django server The port should match the NODEHOST variable set in Djangos localsettingspy    cp node/localsettingsexamplejson node/localsettingsjson    vim node/localsettingsjsonFor development you can run the Node server using nodemon with:    npm start Command Line InterfaceThe shell script cli will invoke a python interpreter with the core models loaded and can be used as a standalone interface to texts or for testing     /cli     p  LinkSetRefGenesis 13     pcount    226 ThanksWere grateful to the following orgazations for providing us with donated services:-

25,Chicago/food-inspections-evaluation,WEB,Chicago,food-inspections-evaluation,30.0,This repository contains the code to generate predictions of critical violations at food establishments in Chicago. It also contains the results of an evaluation of the effectiveness of those predictions.,15.0,2.0,66.0,7.0,58.0,20.0,131.0,2.0,0.0,237750.0,Food Inspections EvaluationThis is our model for predicting which food establishments are at most risk for the types of violations most likely to spread food-borne illness Chicago Department of Public Health staff use these predictions to prioritize inspections During a two month pilot period we found that that using these predictions meant that inspectors found critical violations much fasterYou can help improve the health of our city by improving this model This repository contains a training and test set along with the data used in the current model Feel free to clone fork send pull requests and to file bugs Please note that we will need you to agree to our Contributor License Agreement CLA in order to be able to use any pull requestsOriginal Analysis and Reports-----------------------------In an effort to reduce the publics exposure to foodborne illness the City of Chicagohttps://githubcom/Chicago partnered with Allstates Quantitative Research  Analytics department to develop a predictive model to help prioritize the citys food inspection staff  This Github project is a complete working evaluation of the model including the data that was used in the model the code that was used to produce the statistical results the evaluation of the validity of the results and documentation of our methodologyThe model evaluation calculates individualized risk scores for more than ten thousand Chicagoland food establishments using publically available data most of which is updated nightly on Chicagos data portalhttps://datacityofchicagoorg/ The sole exception is infortmation about the inspectorsThe evaluation compares two months of Chicagos Department of Public Health inspections to an alternative data driven approach based on the model The two month evaluation period is a completely out of sample evaluation based on a model created using test and training data sets from prior time periodsThe reports may be reproduced compiling the knitr documents present in /REPORTSREQUIREMENTS------------All of the code in this project uses the open source statistical application R  We advise that you use R version  31 for best results Ubunutu users may need to install libssl-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev and libxml2-dev  This can be accomplished by typing the following command at the command line:sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libxml2-devThe code makes extensive usage of the datatable package If you are not familiar with the package you might want to consult the datatable FAQ available on CRAN http://cranr-projectorg/web/packages/datatable/vignettes/datatable-faqpdfFILE LAYOUT------The following directory structure is used:DIRECTORY            DESCRIPTION------------------------------------------                  Project files such as README and LICENSE/CODE/            Sequential scripts used to develop model/CODE/functions/  General function definitions which could be used in any script/DATA/            Data files created by scripts in /CODE/ or static/REPORTS/         Reports and other output are located in We have included all of the steps used to develop the model evaluate the results and document the results in the above directory structureThe scripts located in the /CODE/ folder are organized sequentially meaning that the numeric prefix indicates the order in which the script was / should be run in order to reproduce our resultsAlthough we include all the necessary steps to download and transform the data used in the model we also have stored a snapshot of the data in the repository  So to run the model as it stands it is only necessary to download the repository install the dependencies and step through the code in CODE/30glmnetmodelR  If you do not already have them the dependencies can be installed using the startup script CODE/00StartupRDATA------Data used to develop the model is stored in the /DATA directory Chicagos Open Data Portalhttp://datacityofchicagoorg The following datasets were used in the building the analysis-ready dataset Business LicensesFood Inspections CrimeGarbage Cart ComplaintsSanitation ComplaintsWeatherSanitarian InformationThe data sources are joined to create a tabular dataset that paints a statistical picture of a business license- The primary modelling unit / unit of observation in this projectThe data sources are joined in SQLesque manner on appropriate composite keys These keys include Inspection ID Business License and Geography expressed as a Latitude / Longitude combination among others Acknowledgements----------------This research was conducted by the City of Chicago with support from the Civic Consulting Alliancehttp://wwwccachicagoorg/ and Allstate Insurancehttps://wwwallstatecom/ The City would especially like to thank Stephen Collins Gavin Smart Ben Albright and David Crippin for their efforts in developing the predictive model We also appreciate the help of Kelsey Burr Christian Hines and Kiran Pookote in coordinating this research project We

27,torvalds/linux,DEV,torvalds,linux,5137.0,Linux kernel source tree,1000.0,206.0,2.0,126.0,12432.0,8.0,38443.0,123.0,0.0,1965689.0,        Linux kernel release 4x http://kernelorg/These are the release notes for Linux version 4  Read them carefullyas they tell you what this is all about explain how to install thekernel and what to do if something goes wrongWHAT IS LINUX  Linux is a clone of the operating system Unix written from scratch by  Linus Torvalds with assistance from a loosely-knit team of hackers across  the Net It aims towards POSIX and Single UNIX Specification compliance  It has all the features you would expect in a modern fully-fledged Unix  including true multitasking virtual memory shared libraries demand  loading shared copy-on-write executables proper memory management  and multistack networking including IPv4 and IPv6  It is distributed under the GNU General Public License - see the  accompanying COPYING file for more detailsON WHAT HARDWARE DOES IT RUN  Although originally developed first for 32-bit x86-based PCs 386 or higher  today Linux also runs on at least the Compaq Alpha AXP Sun SPARC and  UltraSPARC Motorola 68000 PowerPC PowerPC64 ARM Hitachi SuperH Cell  IBM S/390 MIPS HP PA-RISC Intel IA-64 DEC VAX AMD x86-64 AXIS CRIS  Xtensa Tilera TILE AVR32 ARC and Renesas M32R architectures  Linux is easily portable to most general-purpose 32- or 64-bit architectures  as long as they have a paged memory management unit PMMU and a port of the  GNU C compiler gcc part of The GNU Compiler Collection GCC Linux has  also been ported to a number of architectures without a PMMU although  functionality is then obviously somewhat limited  Linux has also been ported to itself You can now run the kernel as a  userspace application - this is called UserMode Linux UMLDOCUMENTATION: - There is a lot of documentation available both in electronic form on   the Internet and in books both Linux-specific and pertaining to   general UNIX questions  Id recommend looking into the documentation   subdirectories on any Linux FTP site for the LDP Linux Documentation   Project books  This README is not meant to be documentation on the   system: there are much better sources available - There are various README files in the Documentation/ subdirectory:   these typically contain kernel-specific installation notes for some   drivers for example See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what   is contained in each file  Please read the Changes file as it   contains information about the problems which may result by upgrading   your kernel - The Documentation/DocBook/ subdirectory contains several guides for   kernel developers and users  These guides can be rendered in a   number of formats:  PostScript ps PDF HTML  man-pages among others   After installation make psdocs make pdfdocs make htmldocs   or make mandocs will render the documentation in the requested formatINSTALLING the kernel source: - If you install the full sources put the kernel tarball in a   directory where you have permissions eg your home directory and   unpack it:     xz -cd linux-4Xtarxz  tar xvf -   Replace X with the version number of the latest kernel   Do NOT use the /usr/src/linux area This area has a usually   incomplete set of kernel headers that are used by the library header   files  They should match the library and not get messed up by   whatever the kernel-du-jour happens to be - You can also upgrade between 4x releases by patching  Patches are   distributed in the xz format  To install by patching get all the   newer patch files enter the top level directory of the kernel source   linux-4X and execute:     xz -cd /patch-4xxz  patch -p1   Replace x for all versions bigger than the version X of your current   source tree inorder and you should be ok  You may want to remove   the backup files some-file-name or some-file-nameorig and make sure   that there are no failed patches some-file-name or some-file-namerej   If there are either you or I have made a mistake   Unlike patches for the 4x kernels patches for the 4xy kernels   also known as the -stable kernels are not incremental but instead apply   directly to the base 4x kernel  For example if your base kernel is 40   and you want to apply the 403 patch you must not first apply the 401   and 402 patches Similarly if you are running kernel version 402 and   want to jump to 403 you must first reverse the 402 patch that is   patch -R before applying the 403 patch You can read more on this in   Documentation/applying-patchestxt   Alternatively the script patch-kernel can be used to automate this   process  It determines the current kernel version and applies any   patches found     linux/scripts/patch-kernel linux   The first argument in the command above is the location of the   kernel source  Patches are applied from the current directory but   an alternative directory can be specified as the second argument - Make sure you have no stale o files and dependencies lying around:     cd linux     make mrproper   You should now have the sources correctly installedSOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS   Compiling and running the 4x kernels requires up-to-date   versions of various software packages  Consult   Documentation/Changes for the minimum version numbers required   and how to get updates for these packages  Beware that using   excessively old versions of these packages can cause indirect   errors that are very difficult to track down so dont assume that   you can just update packages when obvious problems arise during   build or operationBUILD directory for the kernel:   When compiling the kernel all output files will per default be   stored together with the kernel source code   Using the option make Ooutput/dir allows you to specify an alternate   place for the output files including config   Example:     kernel source code: /usr/src/linux-4X     build directory:    /home/name/build/kernel   To configure and build the kernel use:     cd /usr/src/linux-4X     make O/home/name/build/kernel menuconfig     make O/home/name/build/kernel     sudo make O/home/name/build/kernel modulesinstall install   Please note: If the Ooutput/dir option is used then it must be   used for all invocations of makeCONFIGURING the kernel:   Do not skip this step even if you are only upgrading one minor   version  New configuration options are added in each release and   odd problems will turn up if the configuration files are not set up   as expected  If you want to carry your existing configuration to a   new version with minimal work use make oldconfig which will   only ask you for the answers to new questions -

NOTES on make config:    - Having unnecessary drivers will make the kernel bigger and can      under some circumstances lead to problems: probing for a      nonexistent controller card may confuse your other controllers    - A kernel with math-emulation compiled in will still use the      coprocessor if one is present: the math emulation will just      never get used in that case  The kernel will be slightly larger      but will work on different machines regardless of whether they      have a math coprocessor or not    - The kernel hacking configuration details usually result in a      bigger or slower kernel or both and can even make the kernel      less stable by configuring some routines to actively try to      break bad code to find kernel problems kmalloc  Thus you      should probably answer n to the questions for development      experimental or debugging featuresCOMPILING the kernel: - Make sure you have at least gcc 32 available   For more information refer to Documentation/Changes   Please note that you can still run aout user programs with this kernel - Do a make to create a compressed kernel image It is also   possible to do make install if you have lilo installed to suit the   kernel makefiles but you may want to check your particular lilo setup first   To do the actual install you have to be root but none of the normal   build should require that Dont take the name of root in vain - If you configured any of the parts of the kernel as modules you   will also have to do make modulesinstall - Verbose kernel compile/build output:   Normally the kernel build system runs in a fairly quiet mode but not   totally silent  However sometimes you or other kernel developers need   to see compile link or other commands exactly as they are executed   For this use verbose build mode  This is done by passing   V1 to the make command eg     make V1 all   To have the build system also tell the reason for the rebuild of each   target use V2  The default is V0 - Keep a backup kernel handy in case something goes wrong  This is   especially true for the development releases since each new release   contains new code which has not been debugged  Make sure you keep a   backup of the modules corresponding to that kernel as well  If you   are installing a new kernel with the same version number as your   working kernel make a backup of your modules directory before you   do a make modulesinstall   Alternatively before compiling use the kernel config option   LOCALVERSION to append a unique suffix to the regular kernel version   LOCALVERSION can be set in the General Setup menu - In order to boot your new kernel youll need to copy the kernel   image eg /linux/arch/x86/boot/bzImage after compilation   to the place where your regular bootable kernel is found - Booting a kernel directly from a floppy without the assistance of a   bootloader such as LILO is no longer supported   If you boot Linux from the hard drive chances are you use LILO which   uses the kernel image as specified in the file /etc/liloconf  The   kernel image file is usually /vmlinuz /boot/vmlinuz /bzImage or   /boot/bzImage  To use the new kernel save a copy of the old image   and copy the new image over the old one  Then you MUST RERUN LILO   to update the loading map If you dont you wont be able to boot   the new kernel image   Reinstalling LILO is usually a matter of running /sbin/lilo   You may wish to edit /etc/liloconf to specify an entry for your   old kernel image say /vmlinuxold in case the new one does not   work  See the LILO docs for more information   After reinstalling LILO you should be all set  Shutdown the system   reboot and enjoy   If you ever need to change the default root device video mode   ramdisk size etc  in the kernel image use the rdev program or   alternatively the LILO boot options when appropriate  No need to   recompile the kernel to change these parameters - Reboot with the new kernel and enjoyIF SOMETHING GOES WRONG: - If you have problems that seem to be due to kernel bugs please check   the file MAINTAINERS to see if there is a particular person associated   with the part of the kernel that you are having trouble with If there   isnt anyone listed there then the second best thing is to mail   them to me torvaldslinux-foundationorg and possibly to any other   relevant mailing-list or to the newsgroup - In all bug-reports please tell what kernel you are talking about   how to duplicate the problem and what your setup is use your common   sense  If the problem is new tell me so and if the problem is   old please try to tell me when you first noticed it - If the bug results in a message like     unable to handle kernel paging request at address C0000010     Oops: 0002     EIP:   0010:XXXXXXXX     eax: xxxxxxxx   ebx: xxxxxxxx   ecx: xxxxxxxx   edx: xxxxxxxx     esi: xxxxxxxx   edi: xxxxxxxx   ebp: xxxxxxxx     ds: xxxx  es: xxxx  fs: xxxx  gs: xxxx     Pid: xx process nr: xx     xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx   or similar kernel debugging information on your screen or in your   system log please duplicate it exactly  The dump may look   incomprehensible to you but it does contain information that may   help debugging the problem  The text above the dump is also   important: it tells something about why the kernel dumped code in   the above example its due to a bad kernel pointer More information   on making sense of the dump is in Documentation/oops-tracingtxt - If you compiled the kernel with CONFIGKALLSYMS you can send the dump   as is otherwise you will have to use the ksymoops program to make   sense of the dump but compiling with CONFIGKALLSYMS is usually preferred   This utility can be downloaded from   ftp://ftpcountrykernelorg/pub/linux/utils/kernel/ksymoops/    Alternatively you can do the dump lookup by hand: - In debugging dumps like the above it helps enormously if you can   look up what the EIP value means  The hex value as such doesnt help   me or anybody else very much: it will depend on your particular   kernel setup  What you should do is take the hex value from the EIP   line ignore the 0010: and look it up in the kernel namelist to   see which kernel function contains the offending address   To find out the kernel function name youll need to find the system   binary associated with the kernel that exhibited the symptom  This is   the file linux/vmlinux  To extract the namelist and match it against   the EIP from the kernel crash do:     nm vmlinux  sort  less   This will give you a list of kernel addresses sorted in ascending   order from which it is simple to find the function that contains the   offending address  Note that the address given by the kernel   debugging messages will not necessarily match exactly with the   function addresses in fact that is very unlikely so you cant   just grep the list: the list will however give you the starting   point of each kernel function so by looking for the function that   has a starting address lower than the one you are searching for but   is followed by a function with a higher address you will find the one   you want  In fact it may be a good idea to include a bit of   context in your problem report giving a few lines around the   interesting one   If you for some reason cannot do the above you have a pre-compiled   kernel image or similar telling me as much about your setup as   possible will help  Please read the REPORTING-BUGS document for details - Alternatively you can use gdb on a running kernel read-only ie you   cannot change values or set break points To do this first compile the   kernel with -g edit arch/x86/Makefile appropriately then do a make   clean Youll also need to enable CONFIGPROCFS via make config   After youve rebooted with the new kernel do gdb vmlinux /proc/kcore   You can now use all the usual gdb commands The command to look up the   point where your system crashed is l 0xXXXXXXXX Replace the XXXes   with the EIP value   gdbing a non-running kernel currently fails because gdb wrongly   disregards the starting offset for which the kernel is compiled,0.000393494674931,,False,False,True,False,634115.0,1.0,483.0,0.0,,,0.000322730025275,,,,,,,,0.00271003508298,,,,0.956366682086,,,0.00117491950864,0.0197450627643,,,,,,,,0.00135611002448,0.000140331311734,,,7.33631255486e-05,,,0.0176144895073,3.08226547843e-05,4.61327318061e-06,3.89022641763e-05,2.84436965009e-05

workshop,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,183.0, Just Enough CodeTeaching web design in 2016 shouldnt be about software and which buttons to push This 20-minute segment was part of a pre-conference workshop from the Visual Communication Division of AEJMChttp://wwwaejmcorg/ See slideshttp://wwwslidesharenet/macloo/just-enough-code In my view code is empowering Using code is like using brushes and paint and using software tools is like using an Etch A SketchPhoto: Etch A Sketch toyimages/etch-a-sketchjpgDont teach your students to use thisA WORD OF WARNING: HTML CSS and JavaScript have all evolved over the years When you search online for answers tutorials and examples check carefully to find a date and make sure you are not using old techniques that have been replaced Outdated info is a big source of trouble for beginners Step 1: HTMLUse JSFiddlehttps://jsfiddlenet/ to let students play with HTML tags Students can create a free account save their work and turn in a JSFiddle URL for a grade Here is an examplehttps://jsfiddlenet/macloo/3j60uz7b/ Use the example by changing things adding things moving things Learn code by playing with codeThe key commands in JSFiddle are Run Save and Update and Set as BaseScreen capture: JSFiddle controlsimages/JSFiddle-commandspngFirst focus on learning to use headings paragraphs images and links as in the example Emphasize that HTML is intended to reflect the documents structure For example use an h1 tag only for the top-level heading in the document and do not use h tags h1 through h6 on any text that is not a heading The tags are not meant to make text look a certain way they are meant to mark up the structural elementsh1 /h1p /pimg src alta href /aNote that all images must have an alt attribute or the HTML will not validatehttps://html5validatornu/ If you dont believe me read thishttps://wwwjoedolsoncom/2015/03/are-alt-attributes-required-always/Another thing to note is that today no tags require a slash at the end  /  that was XHTML and its gone All modern browsers support HTML5 now Tags are either paired  p /p  or empty  img Paired tags typically have text between themThe br tag is not intended for creating linespaces Its few legitimate useshttps://developermozillaorg/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/br include postal addresses and poetrypMary McFeebr123 Main StreetbrLittletown FL 32611/ppA fly and a flea in a fluebrWere imprisoned so what could they dobrSaid the fly: Let us fleebrLet us fly said the fleabrSo they flew through a flaw in the flue/pIf you want to introduce bold and italic styles use the strong and em tags not the old b and i tagsAbove all do not let students insert style elements such as fonts and colors into the HTML tags That is not how its done in 2016After headings paragraphs images and links students should learn to use the three types of lists: ordered unordered and definition see example file lines 5173https://githubcom/macloo/justenoughcode/blob/master/basichtmlnocsshtml Save forms and tables for much later Also well get to html head and body in step 3 below Reliable HTML resources: HTMLDog tutorials: HTMLhttp://htmldogcom/guides/html/beginner/ Codecademy HTML  CSShttps://wwwcodecademycom/learn/web Step 2: CSSStill using JSFiddle you can introduce hexadecimal colors  see videohttps://wwwyoutubecom/watchviJcIlC4yFIQindex22listPLZFU-W6LLeecJuSQh20QUUgCmS30sLTB 4 min In CSS the background property determines the background color of an element and the color property determines the foreground or text colorColor will always be separated from the HTML JSFiddle makes it easy to do this from the very start Here is an examplehttps://jsfiddlenet/macloo/79fkd75m/body   background: E2F0D6h1   background: 95AB63  color: F6FFE0Students like using the Adobe Color sitehttps://coloradobecom/ for experimenting with color palettes They can easily copy hexadecimal codes from thereScreen capture: Adobe Color siteimages/adobe-colorjpg Video about using Adobe Colorhttps://wwwyoutubecom/watchvUm7TVYF0QIUlistPLZFU-W6LLeecJuSQh20QUUgCmS30sLTBindex21 4 min 24 sec Video about the hexadecimal color codeshttps://wwwyoutubecom/watchviJcIlC4yFIQlistPLZFU-W6LLeecJuSQh20QUUgCmS30sLTBindex22 4 minAlong with colors you can introduce link styles pseudo classes This is a simple way to start that reinforces working with hexadecimal colors and the background and color properties:a     color: 95AB63a:hover     color: F6FFE0    background: 152C73    text-decoration: noneWhat that does: The first selector a affects all the uses of the a tag on the page In this case the block for a changes the text color to green The second selector a:hover affects all links on the page when they are moused over In this case the block for a:hover contains three declarations that: 1 change the text color to yellow 2 change the background color to dark blue and 3 remove the underline from the link textAfter students have some experience with colors and CSS you can introduce padding margins borders and the CSS box modelhttps://developermozillaorg/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSSBoxModel/IntroductiontotheCSSboxmodel Do not get into DIVs HTML5 elements or positioning until students have experimented with padding margins and bordersUsing borders is a great way to learn the different effects of margins and padding Here is an examplehttps://jsfiddlenet/macloo/ux4kLdLg/ Note that every p element has a red border and the left margin is 50 pixels The h1 element has no border and no margins but it has 20 pixels of padding on all four sidesI recommend saving fonts until later when the students are working with real files and not JSFiddle Using divThe HTML div tag is like duct tape  it has thousands of uses When you wrap HTML in a pair of div tags you can use CSS and JavaScript to do all kinds of things to that wrapped block To target a specific div with CSS we must give it a unique id in the HTML Here is an examplehttps://jsfiddlenet/macloo/hxjn97u5/ Play with it Reliable CSS resources: HTMLDog tutorials: CSShttp://htmldogcom/guides/css/beginner/ Codecademy HTML  CSShttps://wwwcodecademycom/learn/web Step 3: Using a Text Editor and Managing FilesThere is more about code I promise but first we need to talk about text editors for Windows and Mac You need to use a proper text editor for code and you must not use Notepad Windows or TextEdit Mac because they dont do the right things in the right wayScreen capture: Atom text editorimages/atom-screen-shotpngAtomhttps://atomio/ is my top recommendation for everyone  Notepadhttps://notepad-plus-plusorg/ will work for any Windows version in case for some reason Atom does not work for you Both are freeAt this point your students can download a zipped copy of this GitHub repohttps://githubcom/macloo/justenoughcode: Click the Clone or download button and then click Download ZIP This gives them a proper file structure for a project with separate folders for css images and scripts and a few file templates to work withScreen capture: Download from GitHubimages/download-zippngNOTE: You dont need to use GitHub for anything other than this download However learning GitHub and teaching students to use it  in conjunction with the free GitHub apphttps://desktopgithubcom/  is incredibly great for teaching beyond the basics Also: GitHub Pageshttps://pagesgithubcom/ let you publish websites for free Use the example files HTML filehttps://githubcom/macloo/justenoughcode/blob/master/basichtmlwithcsshtml CSS filehttps://githubcom/macloo/justenoughcode/blob/master/css/beginnercss Live pagehttp://macloogithubio/justenoughcode/basichtmlwithcsshtmlAs youll see the live page is not pretty A possible exercise is to improve the page by editing the CSS file The HTML and CSS files are intended to be changed by you or by anyone for learning Good work habitsIts important to start with good work habits for files A few tips:1 Always create a new folder for a new code project2 Inside that folder create three separate folders for css images and scripts3 Save files into their proper folders4 Use relative URLs for images and for links within the project because this makes the project portable When the complete folder is uploaded to a web server everything will work just as it does on the local hard drive Relative URLs and links are explained in this videohttps://wwwyoutubecom/watchvK9NVYCego4listPLZFU-W6LLeecJuSQh20QUUgCmS30sLTBindex13 Document structureThe basic correct standard structure for an HTML document in 2016 is this:DOCTYPE htmlhtml    head        -- meta tags title link tags --    /head    body        -- all content visible to users goes here --    /body/htmlThe contents of the head section and their order are quite important The minimum inside the head is as follows:head    meta charsetutf-8    meta nameviewport contentwidthdevice-width initial-scale1    title write a good title for search engines /title/headIf stylesheets are linked the link tag goes inside the head and below the titleThe meta charset tag is explained well herehttps://developermozillaorg/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/IntroductiontoHTML5Here is a good explanationhttps://developermozillaorg/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewportmetatag of the viewport meta tag Relevance of step 3In this outline I recommend a learning order that corresponds to a progression of expertise in a newsroom or other editing/production environment The basic level of knowledge is HTML step 1 and the ability to write or fix links images etcA little more advanced is the ability to write or fix specific CSS styles such as colors font sizes and margins step 2 Steps 1 and 2 apply to working within content management systems as well as outside themStep 3 goes beyond content management systems such as WordPress and enables  students to create complete standalone documents outside a content management system Being able to use a text editor and manage files means they can create a site consisting of many pages or a single-page application for web or mobile or bothAt this point students can begin learning about: Page layouts and responsive design/design for mobile devices Responsive images Optimizing image file size for best performance Accessibilityhttps://wwww3org/standards/webdesign/accessibility for disabilities Step 4: JavaScript and jQueryThanks to JSFiddlehttps://jsfiddlenet/ which was introduced above students can experiment very quickly with JavaScript and jQuery It helps to understand the basics of HTML and CSS firstWhy teach JavaScript and jQuery to beginners Because JavaScript is what makes digital content interactive If you want it to move spin fold animate calculate or just plain respond then it needs JavaScriptjQueryhttp://jquerycom/ is a JavaScript library and JSFiddle makes it easy to start using it In JSFiddle open the menu in the JavaScript pane shown below change the two fields indicated and youre ready to playScreen capture: jQuery in JSFiddleimages/jQuery-in-JSFiddlepngI like to start students with something they can alter Again JSFiddle is perfect for this Here is an examplehttps://jsfiddlenet/macloo/xegj2oe7/ The jQuery exampleIn that example here are the important parts of the HTML:labelSubject/labelinput typetext idsubject valueThe rainlabelVerb/labelinput typetext idverb valuefallslabelObject/labelinput typetext idobject valueon the plainsp idsentence    Something new will appear here soon/p label is an HTML tag used in conjunction with form fields It contains text This is not relevant to our JavaScript at all We did not mention this tag until now and Ive put it into the HTML because using this tag is the standard way to label a form field input typetext creates a form field into which we can type You might call it a text entry field We can optionally give it a unique id If we do not give it an optional value it will be blank This is another HTML tag that we have not mentioned before p idsentence is a normal p tag with an optional unique id added This is the standard way to designate a unique identifier for any HTML elementThe id is usually the key to manipulating things with JavaScript If something in your HTML has an id you can address it and do things to it with a script Its vital that each id is unique on the page If its not the script will not work properly because it will be looking at more than one thing when it expects only oneTake a moment to play with the live example in JSFiddle Inside the lower right pane change the text several times and watch what happens as a resultNow look at the JavaScript/jQuery code:// when subject value changes change the textsubjectchangefunction     s  subjectvalv  verbvalo  objectval    sentencetexts     v     oThere are two more chunks of code that are nearly identical to that one See if you can find the one-word difference in each chunkIf you discovered that the difference is subject and verb and object in the second line the first line is a comment  congratulationsWhat do those three things refer to They refer to the unique id attributes in the HTML Each id is in an input tag Each chunk of script is listening to a specific input element  the one with the matching id Listening  for what For a change in the element If you change the text and then Tab or Return the script for that text-input goes into actionWhat is the action that ensues It takes place in four parts one part per line of script This is what each line does:1 Puts the value of the text-input with id subject into a variable s2 Puts the value of the text-input with id verb into a variable v3 Puts the value of the text-input with id object into a variable o4 Creates a string from s v and o by adding actually concatenating them together with single spaces: s     v     o Finds the element in the HTML with id sentence  because of sentence Then replaces the text inside that element the p with the new string  because of textRight now you might be wondering how you would ever learn all those bits and pieces and how to put them together Most people learn by looking at fairly simple scripts playing with them and modifying them You dont need to know everything to be able to do somethingNOTE: This script is far from perfect Its worst flaw is redundancy Using JSFiddle you and your students can try to improve this script The pattern for changing thingsThe use of id attributes in the HTML combined with a standard pattern in jQuery makes possible quite a lot of things:someidsomeactionfunction     // code that makes things happen    // can be several lines or oneThis document does not cover the use of id and class in detail The core difference between them is that an id must be unique in a document and class can be reused as many times as needed Thus we can assign one class to several headings and paragraphs on a page and give all of them a bright yellow background like highlighting using CSS We can use jQuery to manipulate both id and class More examplesThe JavaScript/jQuery scripts in these exampleshttps://githubcom/macloo/jQueryuseful are heavily commented so that beginners can learn from themSee my public Fiddleshttps://jsfiddlenet/user/macloo/fiddles/ for more examples Some of the best/easiest ones: animate
