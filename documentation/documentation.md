# InformatiCup2017 Documentation
## Challenge Description
This years InformatiCup challenge was to classify GitHub repositories automatically based on given class descriptions and sample data. In this work we present how we explored the given data, detected relevant features and built an application that predicts repository labels using different machine learning algorithms.


## Data Exploration and Prediction Model
(can still be splitted)
* (visualization)
* analyze and document relevant features
* (explain data cleaning and preprocessing)
* document how to avoid overfitting
* explain why we've decided to use the features
* explain how we've developed the prediction model (splitting methods, ensembling etc.)
* reference GitHub REST/GraphQL API, GitHub Search, Google Search, ...

## Automated Classification
* implement the app that takes the input format and creates the output format
* either 1) prompt for the training data to use or 2) directly include the learned model
* explain the arguments of the main application here while referencing to the manual for setup


## Validation
* boolean(!) matrix on validation data
* compute recall and precision
* discuss quality of results and whether higher yield or higher precision is more important
* (elaborate on the additional dataset given by another team?)


## Extensions
* explain Django app
* reference production instance
* maybe add pictures as fall-back
