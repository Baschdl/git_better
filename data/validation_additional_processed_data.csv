at BootLoader Youd like to create a visualization that helps answer: what kinds of users would be interested in the bicycle projectLuckily youve been collecting analytics data on how your users fund projects You also have software that can send push notification to segments of users based on attributes like location age range gender and mobile deviceFor example you can send a push notification to all iOS users in Chicago IL that says Deep dish lovers unite Help fund the largest pizza in the world on BootLoader The DataYour analytics software tracks the events: View Project and Fund Project for when a user views details about a project and for when they fund a project The events also have the following attributes: category: what the project is about eg Sports Fashion Technology etc clienttime: a UNIX timestamp of when the event occurred amount: how much the user donated for Fund Project onlyNote: The bicycle project belongs to two categories: Sports and EnvironmentAdditionally you know some information about each user on your site that they supplied in a survey when they signed up Specifically you know: sessionid: unique identifier for each user age range: one of 18-24 25-34 35-44 45-54 55 gender: one of M F U location:  city: a city in the United States  state: a state in the United States  latitude  longitude maritalstatus: one of single married device: one of iOS androidFrom past experiments you know that each user generally likes projects from the same category For example User A almost always views and funds projects from the Technology category The bicycle project belongs to two categories: Sports and EnvironmentYou have a sampled time series of 50000 events from one month this year in a JSON blob User data is added into every event Note that BootLoader has more users than are represented by this sampleHeres an example of two events by the same user:          eventname: View Project      gender: M      maritalstatus: single      sessionid: 98ccfbe8c29845c0a44f8e56213d1def      device: android      category: Technology      age: 25-34      clienttime: 1393632024      location:         latitude: 33786594        city: Covina        state:

-118298662        zipcode: 91723           Your submissionOnce again you want to create a visualization that answers: what segments of users would be interested in the bicycle project Based on your visualization BootLoader would send a push notification to those segments that advertises the bicycle projectYou can create any kind of visualization that you think best answers the question eg static or interactive using HTML5 or python Feel free to use any tools youre familiar with or try out that new data viz library you heard so much aboutTo submit your visualization star and fork the data viz

by Marcin Ignac/Variablehttp://variableio/ Bettina Nissen and Kirill KulikovWe are also inviting you to create GitHub Issueshttps://githubcom/tategallery/collection/issues if you notice any bugs or have any ideas for improving the data Thanks for your help Repository ContentsWe offer two data formats:1 A richer dataset is provided in the JSON format which is organised by the directory structure of the Git repository JSON supports more hierarchical or nested information such as subjects2 We also provide CSVs of flattened data which is less comprehensive but perhaps easier to grok The CSVs provide a good introduction to overall contents of the Tate metadata and create opportunities for artistic pivot tables JSON ArtistsEach artist has his or her own JSON file They are found in the artists folder then filed away by first letter of the artists surname ArtworksArtworks are found in the artworks folder They are filed away by accession number This is the unique identifier given to artworks when they come into the Tate collection In many cases the format has significance For example the ar accession number prefix indicates that the artwork is part of ARTIST ROOMS collection The n prefix indicates works that once were part of the National Galleryhttp://wwwnationalgalleryorguk/ collection CSVThere is one CSV file for artists artistdatacsv and one very large for artworks artworkdatacsv which we may one day break up into more manageable chunks The CSV headings should be helpful Let us know if not Entrepreneurial hackers could use the CSVs as an index to the JSON collections if they wanted richer data NB CSV files are encoded as UTF-8 text on which older versions of Excel may choke We have inserted a UTF-8 BOM to help Excel detect the encoding which may or may not be a terrible mistake a nameusage/aUsage guidelines for open data  These usage guidelines are based on goodwill They are not a legal contract but Tate requests that you follow these guidelines if

Boot makes it easy to create Spring-powered production-grade applications andservices with absolute minimum fuss It takes an opinionated view of the Spring platformso that new and existing users can quickly get to the bits they needYou can use Spring Boot to create stand-alone Java applications that can be started usingjava -jar or more traditional WAR deployments We also provide a command line toolthat runs spring scriptsOur primary goals are: Provide a radically faster and widely accessible getting started experience for allSpring development Be opinionated out of the box but get out of the way quickly as requirements start todiverge from the defaults Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projectseg embedded servers security metrics health checks externalized configuration Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration Installation and Getting StartedThe docs/htmlsingle/reference documentation includes

Check the docs/htmlsingle/reference documentation especially the  docs/htmlsingle/howtoHow-tos -- they provide solutions to the most common  questions Learn the Spring basics -- Spring Boot builds on many other Spring projects check  the http://springiospringio web-site for a wealth of reference documentation If  you are just starting out with Spring try one of the http://springio/guidesguides Ask a question - we monitor http://stackoverflowcomstackoverflowcom for questions  tagged with http://stackoverflowcom/tags/spring-bootspring-boot Report bugs with Spring Boot at https://githubcom/spring-projects/spring-boot/issuesgithubcom/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues Reporting IssuesSpring Boot uses GitHubs integrated issue tracking system to record bugs and featurerequests If you want to raise an issue please follow the recommendations below: Before you log a bug please https://githubcom/spring-projects/spring-boot/searchtypeIssuessearch the issue tracker  to see if someone has already reported the problem If the issue doesnt already exist https://githubcom/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/newcreate a new issue Please provide as much information as possible with the issue report we like to know  the version of Spring Boot that you are using as well as your Operating System and  JVM version If you need to paste code or include a stack trace use Markdown  escapes  before and after your text If possible try to create a test-case or project that replicates the issue You can  submit sample projects as pull-requests against the  https://githubcom/spring-projects/spring-boot-issuesspring-boot-issues GitHub  project Use the issue number for the name of your project Building from SourceYou dont need to build from source to use Spring Boot binaries inhttp://repospringiorepospringio but if you want to try out the latest andgreatest Spring Boot can be easily built with thehttps://githubcom/takari/maven-wrappermaven wrapper You also need JDK 18 althoughBoot applications can run on Java 16indent0---- /mvnw clean install----If you want to build with the regular mvn command you will needhttp://mavenapacheorg/run-maven/indexhtmlMaven v321 or aboveNOTE: You may need to increase the amount of memory available to Maven by settinga MAVENOPTS environment variable with the value -Xmx512m Rememberto set the corresponding property in your IDE as well if you are building and runningtests there eg in Eclipse go to Preferences-Java-Installed JREs and edit theJRE definition so that all processes are launched with those arguments This propertyis automatically set if you use the maven wrapperAlso see link:CONTRIBUTINGadocCONTRIBUTINGadoc if you wish to submit pull requestsand in particular please fill out thehttps://supportspringsourcecom/springcommittersignupContributors Agreementbefore your first change however trivial Or if you filed such an agreement already foranother project just mention that in your pull request Building reference documentationThe reference documentation requires the documentation of the Maven plugin to beavailable so you need to build that first since its not generated by defaultindent0---- /mvnw clean install -pl spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-maven-plugin -Pdefaultfull----The documentation also includes auto-generated information about the starters Toallow this information to be collected the starter projects must be built first:indent0---- /mvnw clean install -f spring-boot-starters----Once this is done you can build the reference documentation with the command below:indent0---- /mvnw clean prepare-package -pl spring-boot-docs -Pdefaultfull----TIP: The generated documentation is available from spring-boot-docs/target/contents/reference ModulesThere are a number of modules in Spring Boot here is a quick overview: spring-bootThe main library providing features that support the other parts of Spring Bootthese include: The SpringApplication class providing static convenience methods that make it easyto write a stand-alone Spring Application Its sole job is to create and refresh anappropriate Spring ApplicationContext Embedded web applications with a choice of container Tomcat or Jetty for now First class externalized configuration support Convenience ApplicationContext initializers including support for sensible loggingdefaults spring-boot-autoconfigureSpring Boot can configure large parts of common applications based on the contentof their classpath A single EnableAutoConfiguration annotation triggersauto-configuration of the Spring contextAuto-configuration attempts to deduce which beans a user might need For example IfHSQLDB is on the classpath and the user has not configured any database connectionsthen they probably want an in-memory database to be defined Auto-configuration willalways back away as the user starts to define their own beans spring-boot-startersStarters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include inyour application You get a one-stop-shop for all the Spring and related technologythat you need without having to hunt through sample code and copy paste loads ofdependency descriptors For example if you want to get started using Spring and JPA fordatabase access just include the spring-boot-starter-data-jpa dependency in yourproject and you are good to go spring-boot-cliThe Spring command line application compiles and runs Groovy source making it supereasy to write the absolute minimum of code to get an application running Spring CLIcan also watch files automatically recompiling and restarting when they change spring-boot-actuatorSpring Boot Actuator provides additional auto-configuration to decorate your applicationwith features that make it instantly deployable and supportable in production  Forinstance if you are writing a JSON web service then it will provide a server securitylogging externalized configuration management endpoints an audit abstraction andmore If you want to switch off the built in features or extend or replace them itmakes that really easy as well spring-boot-loaderSpring Boot Loader provides the secret sauce that allows you to build a single jar filethat can be launched using java -jar Generally you will not need to usespring-boot-loader directly but instead work with thelink:spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-gradle-pluginGradle orlink:spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-maven-pluginMaven plugin SamplesGroovy samples for use with the command line application are available inlink:spring-boot-cli/samplesspring-boot-cli/samples To run the CLI samples typespring run samplegroovy from samples directoryJava samples are available in link:spring-boot-samplesspring-boot-samples and shouldbe built with maven and run by invoking java -jar target/samplejar GuidesThe http://springio/springio site contains several guides that show how to use SpringBoot step-by-step: http://springio/guides/gs/spring-boot/Building an Application with Spring Boot is a  very basic guide that shows you how to create a simple application run it and add some  management services http://springio/guides/gs/actuator-service/Building a RESTful Web Service with Spring  Boot Actuator is a guide to creating a REST web service and also shows how the server  can be configured http://springio/guides/gs/convert-jar-to-war/Converting a Spring Boot JAR Application  to a WAR shows you how to run applications in a web server as a WAR file

and trust me you dont want to process the XML dump  using a DOM parser and XPath either- To reduce maintainance OSM is heavily designed to share nodes and ways for  multiple purposes In particular for boundaries a single way can be used  multiple times such as denote the border of two countries and participating  in the polygons of countries counties cities at the border - Assembling polygons in OSM is quite tricky and often polygons are incomplete  see also the documentation on OSM multipolygonshttp://wikiopenstreetmaporg/wiki/Relation:multipolygonMy first prototypes in Python were running out of memory on the full data setreducing the data set via Osmosis did not work as it led to missing ways So Ineeded to carefully build this in Java to conserve memory Osmosis reads andwrites data multiple times to large temporary files - I decided to design myapproach around reading the input data multiple times instead even if thismeans re-reading data unnecessarily at the benefit of not having to writelarge temporary files Index QueryQuering the index is easy It requires a single classReverseGeocodersrc/main/java/com/kno10/reversegeocode/query/ReverseGeocoderjavaand a data file pregenerated data available under the ODbL licensedata/This class only depends on the JDK on no other classes or packagesIn particular you do not need a Mavenized package of this project For this reasonI have also chosen a very permissive 2-clause BSD license for the lookup code    ReverseGeocoder rgc  new ReverseGeocoderfilename    //     String metadata  rgclookuplongitude latitudePay attention to the order of longitude and latitude The order of these two valuesis inconsistent across different applications This has been a mess historicallyand we are not going to fix this here We chose longitude latitude because it seemsmore intuitive to us to use x y as commonly seen on a map This is also theorder used by GeoJSONhttp://geojsonorg/ Plus the run lengthencoding supposedly works better this directionEach metadata entry is a tab separated array as generated by the parser from the OSM fileThe exact columns are easy to vary For the provided data files there isdocumentation in the data folderdata/ PerformanceSo how incredibly fast is itIve added JMH unit tests to benchmark the throughput on a i7-3770 CPU with 34 GHzValues are given in microseconds 1us  1e-6 s per operation and operations per microsecond Method                              Resolution  Runtime       Throughput    :----------------------------------------------:-------------:--------------: Lookup with caching of entities          05-2   0231 us/op   4316 ops/us  Lookup with caching of entities         005-2   0575 us/op   1706 ops/us  Lookup with caching of entities        0005-2   0971 us/op   1052 ops/us  Lookup with caching of entities       00005-2   1562 us/op   0639 ops/us  Lookup without caching of entities       05-2   0683 us/op   1439 ops/us  Lookup without caching of entities      005-2   1114 us/op   0928 ops/us  Lookup without caching of entities     0005-2   1423 us/op   0668 ops/us  Lookup without caching of entities    00005-2   2057 us/op   0473 ops/us  Open query close cycles                05-2  13542 us/op   0078 ops/us  Open query close cycles               005-2  21221 us/op   0048 ops/us  Open query close cycles              0005-2  36250 us/op   0027 ops/us  Open query close cycles             00005-2  84306 us/op   0013 ops/us  Random lonlat pair generation             n/a   0047 us/op  21297 ops/us As you can see there is a benefit from using the caching included and the setup cost ofthe memory map is not negligible -

in particular the first 20 bits of each id are usually 0Since our desired output resolution is much less than 001 degree we also encodeeach coordinate approximately using a single integer Implementation NotesWhile osmosis --used-way --used-node did not work for me with tag filters itapparently worked just fine without Using these filters can reduce theplanet file substantially from 30 GB to 51 GB This is worthdoing as a preprocessing stepAs of now you will need to use a Debian Linux systemSome of the libraries are not available on Maven central so I had to putsystem paths have a look at the pomxml for what you need Index constructionThe index essentially is a large pixmap referencing metadata from OSM accompaniedwith a table containing the metadata from the index RenderingRendering is currently done via JavaFX so you will also need to have a UI forbuilding an index Unfortunately this is also rather slow 10-30 minutesdepending on the desired resolution and number of polygons to render Howeverwe needed an API that can render polygons with the even-odd rule and antialiasingand the java-gnome Cairo API wouldnt allow us access the resulting bitmaps withoutwriting them to disk as PNGSince the JavaFX renderer has a texture limit of 8192x8192 we need to render smaller patchesand combine them to get a high-resolution map File FormatThe file format is designed to be low-level compact and efficient It is meant tobe used via read-only shared memory mapping to make best use of operatingsystem caching capabilities The compression is less than what you could obtain withPNG encoding or GZIP but it allows skipping over data without decoding it intoapplication memory1 4 bytes: magic header that identifies the file format Currentlythis is the code 0x6e06e001 and I will increment the last byte on format changes2 4 bytes: width of the map in pixel3 4 bytes: height of the map in pixel4 4 bytes: width of the map in degree5 4 bytes: height of the map in degree6 4 bytes: longitude offset of the map in degree usually 1807 4 bytes: latitude offset of the map in degree8 4 bytes: number of entities max 0x80009 height  4 bytes: file offset of each row monotone increasing10 nument  4 bytes: file offset of metadata monotone11 file size  end of last entity12 x bytes for each row as listed before row encoding: see below13 x bytes for each metadataEach map row is encoded using a run-length encoding consisting of two varintsThe first varint is the entity number the second is the run length -

to the above Pants build systemPants is a build system that works particularly well for a source code workspace containing manydistinct but interdependent piecesPants is similar to make maven ant gradle sbt etc but pants pursues different design goalsPants optimizes for: building multiple dependent things from source building code in a variety of languages speed of build executionPants is a true community project with major contributions from Twitter Foursquare Square among othercompanies and independent contributors It has friendly documentation herehttps://pantsbuildgithubioin this README we will just touch on how to compile and test the code Compiling and Testing First RunThe first run will take a long time aspom-resolvehttps://githubcom/foursquare/fsqio/tree/master/src/python/fsqio/pants/pomour custom resolver for 3rdparty dependencies computes the project graph and downloads the dependenciesMaybe as long as 15-20 mins A good first run is to get this out of the way:     /pants pom-resolve Targets and BUILD filesTargets are adressable project or dependency level modules that can be built by Pants BUILD files areconfiguration files that define targets that can be built by Pants Each target has a name and can be builtby running a Pants task against the targets name and locationFor example Fsqios JVM projects live under src/jvmherehttps://githubcom/foursquare/fsqio/tree/master/src/jvm/io/fsq You can compile Rogue by running:     /pants compile src/jvm/io/fsq/rogue:rogue Build and Test every projectAdding a :: to a path will glob every target under that location So to compile every target in Fsqio:     /pants compile src::Similarly to run all the tests after starting the mongodb server:    /pants test test::Projects aspirationally have READMEs at the project root Acknowledgements Thanks to the great community supporting Pantshttps://githubcom/pantsbuild/pants Fsqio is split from

Statushttps://securetravis-ciorg/meltingice/CamanJSpnghttp://travis-ciorg/meltingice/CamanJSThe main focus of CamanJS is manipulating images using the HTML5 canvas and Javascript Its a combination of a simple-to-use interface with advanced and efficient image/canvas editing techniques It is also completely library independent and can be safely used next to jQuery YUI Scriptaculous MooTools etcCamanJS is very easy to extend with new filters and plugins and it comes with a wide array of image editing functionality which is only growing as the community makes more plugins All features that are not a part of the core CamanJS library are in a separate plugins repositoryhttps://githubcom/meltingice/CamanJS-PluginsFor more information I highly recommend taking a look at the official websitehttp://camanjscom where there is more comprehensive documentation and interactive demos You can also read the wikihttps://githubcom/meltingice/CamanJS/wiki for some basic information about the project and how to use itCamanJS is written in Coffeescripthttp://coffeescriptorg as of version 30 It works both in-browser and in NodeJS UsageInclude one of the versions in the dist/ folder then you can run:jsCamanimage-id function    thisbrightness10  thiscontrast20  thisrenderfunction      alertDone  Caman also supports modifying images via the data-caman HTML attribute Simply separate each instruction with a space Images with the data-caman attribute will automatically be modified at page loadhtmlimg data-camansaturation-10 brightness20 vignette10 srcpath/to/imagejpg HiDPI SupportVersion 4 introduces better support for HiDPI Retina displays It allows you to specify a higher resolution replacement using HTML data attributes Keep in mind however that higher resolution images take longer to renderHTML data attributes data-caman-hidpi: URL to the high resolution replacement image data-caman-hidpi-disabled: HiDPI support is enabled by default so add this attribute if you wish to force disable it Upgrading to Version 4There is only 1 breaking change that occured with the version 4 release When you initialize CamanJS with a canvas and an image the parameter order has changed It is now: javascriptCamancanvas-id /path/to/imagepng function This is in order to be more consistent with initialization such that the initialization object is always the first parameter Update your code accordingly DevelopmentIf you are a developer who is contributing directly to the project there are some tools to help you out BuildingTo install all dependencies required for development run npm install -dBecause all plugins are in a separate repository make sure you run:git submodule init  git submodule updateTo build simply run cake build The resulting files will be placed in the dist/ folder Plugins will be automatically discovered and added to camanfulljs after the core library You can also auto-compile when a file changes by using cake watchIf you add any files to the core library you will need to add them to the coffeeFiles array in the Cakefile The point of this is so that order is preserved when generating the file JS file Plugins do not need to be added to the CakefileYou will probably want to generate documentation if you make any changes In addition to the normal requirements you will also need the Python library PygmentsTo generate the documentation run cake docs CDN JS HostingCamanJS is hosted on CDN JS if youre looking for a CDN hosting solution It is the full and minified version of the library which means all plugins are included Simply load CamanJS directly from this URLhttp://cdnjscloudflarecom/ajax/libs/camanjs/330/camanfullminjs for usage on your site NodeJS CompatibilityCamanJS is fully compatible with NodeJS The easiest way to install it is:npm install camanSaving from NodeJSTo save your modified image in NodeJS simply call the save function after rendering is finished by passing a callback function to render Trying to save before rendering is finished will cause issues javascriptCaman  requirecamanCamanCaman/path/to/filejpg function    thisbrightness40  thisrenderfunction      thissave/outputpng   TestingTests for CamanJS run both in NodeJS and the browser NodeJSThe NodeJS tests use mocha as the test runner The simplest way to run the test suite is by running npm test BrowserThe browser tests are run by Karma It will start up Chrome Firefox and Safari if running OSX in the background You can minimize each of these browsers if desired It will automatically run tests after CamanJS is recompiled by the Cakefile as wellYou can run Karma by running karma start or you can do a single run with the NodeJS tests by running npm

autocomplete componentBrowser support includes every sane browser and IE7 DemoYou can see a live demo here3screenshotpng53 InspirationI needed a fast easy to use and reliable autocomplete library The ones I stumbled upon were too bloated too opinionated or provided an unfriendly human experienceThe goal is to produce a framework-agnostic autocomplete that is easily integrated into your favorite MVC framework that doesnt translate into a significant addition to your codebase and thats enjoyable to work with Horsey shares the modular design philosophy of Rome the datetime picker1 Furthermore it plays well with Insignia the tag editor2 component and pretty much any other well-delimited component out there Features- Small and focused- Natural keyboard navigation- Progressively enhanced- Extensive browser support- Fuzzy searching- Supports input and textarea elements InstallYou can get it on npmshellnpm install horsey --saveOr bower tooshellbower install horsey --save OptionsEntry point is horseyel options Configuration options are detailed below This method returns a small APIapi into the horsey autocomplete list instance You can also find existing horsey instances using horseyfind suggestionsAn array containing a list of suggestions to be presented to the user Each suggestion can be either a string or an object If an object is used the text property will be used for displaying the suggestion and the value property will be used when a suggestion is selectedAlternatively the suggestions can be a function In this case the function will be called when the input is focused and expected to return a list of suggestions through a callback ExampleThe example below would create an instance with a predefined set of suggestionsjshorseyel   suggestions: sports drama romantic comedy science fiction thriller ExampleHeres how you would lazy load your suggestions except you know using actual AJAX calls Note that this method is called a single timejshorseyel   suggestions: function done     setTimeoutfunction        donesports drama romantic comedy science fiction thriller     2000   filterAllows you to hide suggestions based on user input The default implementation uses the fuzzysearch4 module to discard suggestions that dont contain anything similar to the user input Defaultjsfunction defaultFilter q suggestion   return fuzzysearchq getTextsuggestion  fuzzysearchq getValuesuggestion ExampleThe example below would always display every suggestion except when the user input looks like seahawks/managers in which case it would only return suggestions matching the seahawks teamjshorseyel   filter: function q suggestion     var parts  qsplit/    return partslength  1  true : suggestionteam  parts0   limitAllows you to limit the amount of search results that are displayed by horsey Defaults to Infinity getTextA function that returns the textual representation to be displayed on the suggestion list The result of getText is also used when filtering under the default implementation Defaultjsfunction defaultGetText suggestion   return typeof suggestion  string  suggestion : suggestiontext ExampleThe example below would return a models displayName for conveniencejshorseyel   getText: function suggestion     return suggestiondisplayName   getValueA function that returns the value to be given to the el when a suggestion is selected Defaultjsfunction defaultGetValue suggestion   return typeof suggestion  string  suggestion : suggestionvalue ExampleThe example below would return a models username for conveniencejshorseyel   getValue: function suggestion     return suggestionusername   setA function that gets called when an option has been selected on the autocomplete Defaultjsfunction defaultSetter value   elvalue  value ExampleThe example below would append values instead of overwriting themjshorseyel   set: function value     elvalue  value      anchorA string that will be used as a regular expression to figure out when the suggestions should be presented If an anchor is set the text will be appended instead of replaced and the set option will be ignored autoHideOnClickHides the autocomplete list whenever something other than the el or any child of the autocompletes ul element is clicked Defaults to true autoHideOnBlurHides the autocomplete list whenever something other than the el or any child of the autocompletes ul element is focused Defaults to true autoShowOnUpDownDisplays the autocomplete list whenever the up arrow key or the down arrow key are pressed Defaults to eltagName  INPUT renderA function thats used to decide what to display in each suggestion item render will take the li element as the first argument and the suggestion model as the second argument Defaultjsfunction defaultRenderer li suggestion   liinnerText  litextContent  getTextsuggestion ExampleThe example below would assign arbitrary HTML found in the suggestion model to each list item Note that rendering doesnt necessarily have to be synchronousjshorseyel   render: function li suggestion     liinnerHTML  suggestionhtml   appendToWhere should the ul element containing the autocomplete options be placed Generally an irrelevant option but useful if youre dealing with a SPA where you want to keep the element inside your view instead of the body so that it gets cleaned up as the view goes awayDefaults to documentbody formThe form your el belongs to If provided the autocomplete list will be hidden whenever the form is submitted APIOnce youve instantiated a horsey you can do a few more things with it addsuggestionJust like when passing suggestions as an option you can add individual suggestions by calling addsuggestion Returns the li element for this suggestion in the autocomplete list There isnt an API method to remove the suggestion afterwards so youll have to grab onto the li reference if you want to remove it later on clearYou can however remove every single suggestion from the autocomplete wiping the slate clean Contrary to destroy clear wont leave the horsey instance useless and calling add will turn it back online in no time listThe autocomplete list DOM ul element suggestionsExposes the suggestions that have been added so far to the autocomplete list Includes suggestions that may not be shown due to filtering This should be treated as a read-only list showShows the autocomplete list hideHides the autocomplete list toggleShows or hides the autocomplete list refreshPositionUpdates the position of the autocomplete list relative to the position of the el Only necessary when the el is moved destroyUnbind horsey-related events from the el remove the autocomplete list Its like horsey was never here retargettargetDetaches this horsey

How do I get this to run on my box   - See doc/buildingmd/doc/buildingmd - I compiled everything Now how do I run it   - Execute /run you will be prompted by the convert script/doc/mediaconvertmd to convert the original game assets to the a lot saner and more moddable openage format The game starts when this is done - Waaaaaah It   - segfaults   - prints error messages I dont want to read   - ate my dogAll of those are features not bugsTo turn them off use /run --dont-segfault --no-errors --dont-eat-dogIf this still does not help try the contact sectioncontactor the bug trackerhttps://githubcom/SFTtech/openage/issuesATM openage is mostly designed to be built and run inside the development folder via make run /run /runpy or python3 -m openage those all are equivalent but make install might actually workTo run the globally installed version: python3 -m openageDevelopment Process-------------------What does openage development look like in practice -

Bannerscreenshots/packetsenderdotcompngPacket Sender is an open source utility to allow sending and receiving TCP and UDP packets The mainline branch officially supports Windows Mac and Ubuntu Desktop Linux Other places may recompile and redistribute Packet Sender Packet Sender is free and licensed GPL v2 or later It can be used for both commercial and personal use DownloadOfficial releases of Packet Sender can be downloaded at  PacketSendercomhttp://packetsendercom/ Some places redistribute Packet SenderPacket Sender logoscreenshots/WindowsLogoTransparent670x600-150x150pngPacket Sender logoscreenshots/maclogopngPacket Sender logoscreenshots/ubuntu-logo-transparentpng Packet Sender DocumentationSome knowledge of a basic network protocols is a prerequisite to using Packet Sender Beyond that Packet Sender was designed to be very easy to use Simply start using it Support Stack Overflow: stackoverflowcom/searchqpacketsenderhttp://stackoverflowcom/searchqpacketsender Twitter: NagleCodehttp://twittercom/naglecode You may also track this project on GitHub Secure Anonymous Email: DanNaglecom/contacthttp://DanNaglecom/contact Portable ModePacket Sender has a portable mode At launch it will look for packetsini and pssettingsini in its run-time directory Windows users this directory is the same place as the exe For Mac users this run-time directory is at PacketSenderapp/Contents/MacOS If INI files are found it will use them instead of APPDATA or Library/Application Support Documentation GUIPacket Sender is identical for all the desktop versions The only difference is its theme to match the operating systemPacket Sender screenshotscreenshots/packetsenderwindowsscreenshotpng In the bottom right there are UDP server and TCP server status and port You can click to activate or deactivate these During packet resending there will be a button to cancel all resends Please check your firewall Windows aggressively blocks TCP-based servers Packet Sender will still work if the firewall blocks it but it cant receive unsolicited TCP-based packets In the table there is a list of saved packets You can double-click to directly edit fields in this table Select multiple packets to enable Multi-Send Selected packets are shown in a quick-send area above the traffic log Fields can be rearranged by drag-and-drop in the settings menu A resend value of 0 means it is a single-shot packet A packet has a name destination address domains will trigger an IP lookup port and data associated with it Click Send to immediately send Click Save to send later Packet Sender supports mixed ASCII and HEX notation:   XX gets translated to XX in hex   n and r will get translated to 0A and 0D   HEX numbers are space delimited   Example ASCII: hello worldr   Example HEX: 68 65 6c 6c 6f 20 77 6f 72 6c 64 0d   You may save a packet directly from the traffic log You will be prompted for a name and the source address and port will be switched for your convenience An optional response can be sent The same response is used for TCP and UDP Persistent TCPPacket Sender supports persistent connections via a separate UI dialog It is enabled by  checkbox on the main window Packet Sender Direct TCPscreenshots/packetsenderdirecttcppng Any number of persistent connections can be created Previously saved packets can be loaded in the drop-down There is a raw view and ASCII view The ASCII view is useful to troubleshoot data that is not printed by the raw view Traffic is also saved in the main window traffic log The timer in the bottom lefts starts as soon as a valid data packet is sent It stops when the server closes the connection You may optionally append a carriage return when you quick-send by hitting the return key This is useful for command-prompt menus over TCP connectionsPersistent connections is not supported via the command line Additional Configuration Options The traffic log and packet table is divided by a draggable splitter This splitter can also be collapsed on either side Copy to the clipboard the raw packet data instead of a translation -- my personal preference Traffic log can be set to roll at 100 entries Import/Export of packets is available via menus Attempt receive before send some servers expect this behavior 500 ms delay before sending data some servers are slow Documentation Command LineThe command line extension used in Windows installations is com Using exe will launch the GUI Leave off the extension and Windows will choose the correct program The same executable controls the command line and GUI for Mac and Linux operating systemsPacket Sender CLI screenshotscreenshots/packetsendercommandlinepngThe command line system in Packet Sender follows the same pattern as other Linux utilities It has a long name such as --version and a short name such as -v These options can be arranged in any order and Packet Sender will parse them correctly The last 3 options are positional and must appear last They are IP port and data These last options are optional if using a stored packet    packetsender --help    Usage: packetsender options address port data    Packet Sender is a

a new or undocumented process is uncontrolled reactive and unpredictable typically driven by individuals without coordination or communication Success depends on individual heroics2 Managed - a process is partially documented possibly leading to consistent results Success depends on discipline3 Defined - a process is documented standardized and integrated into other processes Success depends on automation4 Measured - the process is quantitatively managed Success depends on measuring metrics against business goals5 Optimized - the process is continually and reliably improving through both incremental and innovative changes Success depends on reducing the risk of change Potential applications of the Maturity ModelThe maturity model is being developed with two primary goals in mind:- Evaluating how GitHub products programs services and resources are helping customers develop more mature practices around open source- Creating a comprehensive starter kit that includes all the resources needed to use contribute to release and manage open source projects on GitHub Current StatusThe maturity model is currently a very early concept and actively being developed Sticky Notes for brainstorming the activities involved in open sourcehttps://stickiesio/boards/564eda3fefefba0b2fe8a0721 Bookmarks primary sources and notes are being gathered in an Evernote notebookhttps://wwwevernotecom/pub/bkeepers/maturitymodel Credits- Wikipedia: Capability Maturity Modelhttps://enwikipediaorg/wiki/CapabilityMaturityModel- Martin Fowler: MaturityModelhttp://martinfowlercom/bliki/MaturityModelhtml LicenseCopyright  2016 GitHub Inc and Contributors This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 40 International Licensehttp://creativecommonsorg/licenses/by/40/,False,False,True,False,False,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Repository enthlt alle Deutschen Bundesgesetze und -verordnungenim Markdown-Formathttp://daringfireballnet/projects/markdown/ Als Quelledienen die XML-Versionen der Gesetze vonwwwgesetze-im-internetdehttp://wwwgesetze-im-internetde/Warum Git----------Jeder Brger kann den aktuellen Stand von Gesetzen sehr einfach online findenAllerdings ist die Entstehung die historische Entwicklung und dieAktualisierung von Gesetzen nicht einfach und frei nachvollziehbar Das liegtdaran dass Gesetze nur in ihrer aktuellsten Version prsentiert werden undnderungen an diesen Gesetzen nicht maschinenlesbar vorliegen Dies soll hiergendert werden: die aktuellste Version eines Gesetzes wird hier mit Gitversioniert gespeichert Das erlaubt es die Mchtigkeit von Git auf Gesetzeund auf den Gesetzgebungsprozess anzuwenden Das Einpflegen der komplettendeutschen Gesetzesvergangenheit in Git ist das ferne ZielWarum Markdown---------------Gesetze sind Prosa sie enthalten keine maschinenlesbare Semantik EineAuszeichnungssprache wie XML verringert die Menschenlesbarkeit erschwert diemaschinelle Erkennung von Unterschieden und beinhaltet viel berflssigeSyntaxMarkdown ist eine intuitive Formatierung von Text die ohne zustzlicheProgramme fr Menschen les- und schreibbar ist Das passt zu Gesetzestextendie nur minimale Formatierung bentigen Weiterhin lsst sich Markdown inandere Formate wie HTML konvertieren und ist damit maschinen-formatierbarPull Requests-------------Pull Requests knnen gerne geffnet werden Natrlich werden nur solchegemergt die tatschlich vom Bundestag verabschiedet wurden und Gesetzgeworden sindDennoch sind nderungsvorschlge an Gesetzen von Parteien oder aus derZivilgesellschaft als Pull Request ntzlich Die nderungen lassen sicheinfacher im Kontext verstehen knnen direkt am Gesetz diskutiert undnachvollziehbar verndert werdenOffizielle Gesetzesentwrfe wenn ffentlich verfgbar werden vom Fork derBundesregierunghttps://githubcom/bundesregierung/ als Pull Request andieses Repository gestelltFehler und Bitte um Mithilfe----------------------------Es wird kein Anspruch auf Korrektheit erhoben Bitte verlassen Sie sich nurauf offizielle QuellenDie XML-Quelle ist nicht fehlerfrei und die Konvertierung von XML nachMarkdown ist es auch nicht Das liegt daran dass die Gesetze im XML-Formatdas Markup auch fr stilistische Auszeichnungen statt nur fr semantischeAuszeichnungen nutzen Dies erschwert eine Konvertierung und fhrt zufehlerhaftem Markdown Da fehlerhaftes Markdown immer noch gut lesbar istfhrt dies erst bei einer Weiterverarbeitung zu ProblemenCommits richten sich nach Mglichkeit nach den Verffentlichungen imBundesgesetzblatt und im Amtlichen Teil des Bundesanzeigers Das funktioniertnicht immer problemlos und erfordert menschliche UntersttzungWerkzeuge die die Aktualisierung vereinfachen finden sich imgesetze-tools repositoryhttps://githubcom/bundestag/gesetze-toolsMithilfe ist erwnschtUm die Fhigkeiten von Git optimal zu nutzen wird es ntig sein Commits dieGesetzesnderungen einbringen von Commits die zB Korrekturen an der Syntaxvornehmen oder die README verndern zu unterscheiden Hier wird um Mithilfebei der Ausarbeitung eines Git-Workflowshttps://githubcom/bundestag/gesetze/wiki/Git-Workflowfr dieses Repostiory gebetenRechtliches-----------Gesetze sind amtliche Werke und unterliegen nicht dem UrheberrechtKontakt-------Twitter: bundesgithttps://twittercom/bundesgit--------english versionGerman Federal Laws and RegulationsThis Git repository contains all German federal laws and regulations inMarkdown formathttp://daringfireballnet/projects/markdown/ The sourceis the XML version of the laws fromwwwgesetze-im-internetdehttp://wwwgesetze-im-internetde/Why Git----------All German citizens can easily find an up-to-date version of their laws onlineHowever the legislation process the historic evolution and the updates to lawsare not easily and freely trackable The reason is that laws are only publishedin their most recent version and changes to laws are not available in amachine-readable formatThis should change: the current state of laws will be stored in this repositoryunder Git version control This allows the power of Git to be applied to thelegislation process Integrating the whole history of German law changes in Gitis the ambitious goalWhy Markdown-------------Laws are prose they do not contain machine-readable semanticsA complex markup language like XML reduces the human-readabilitymakes detection of differences harder and contains lots ofunnecessary syntaxMarkdown is an intuitive formatting of text that is readable andwritable by humans without the need of additional tools That fitsthe nature of laws that only need minimal formatting FurthermoreMarkdown is machine-formattable and can be converted to other formatslike HTMLPull Requests-------------You are encouraged to open pull request Of course only valid legislationvoted on by the Bundestag will be mergedHowever law change proposals as pull requests coming from parties orNGOs can be useful to understand context discuss changes directly wherethey will happen and keep changes accountableOfficial change proposals from our government will be opened as pullrequests from the fork of the Bundesregierunghttps://githubcom/bundesregierung/as they become publicy availableMistakes and call for help--------------------------There is no guarantee on correctness Please only trust official sourcesThe source XML is not without mistakes and neither is the conversion toMarkdown Thats because the source XML uses markup for style and not onlyfor semantics This makes conversion harder and comes down to faultyMarkdown However faulty Markdown is still very readable and will onlycause problems when processed furtherCommits will be based on published changes Bundesgesetzblatt and BundesanzeigerThat doesnt work without problems and requires human interactionTools that make updates easier can be found in thegesetze-tools repositoryhttps://githubcom/bundestag/gesetze-toolsHelp neededIn order to make the most out of Git we need to distinguish between law changecommits and commits that fix eg syntax mistakesPlease help shape a Git Workflowhttps://githubcom/bundestag/gesetze/wiki/Git-Workflowfor this repositoryLegal Stuff-----------All laws are offical works and are not under copyright

our contributorshttps://githubcom/NYTimes/objective-c-style-guide/contributors IntroductionHere are some of the documents from Apple that informed the style guide If something isnt mentioned here its probably covered in great detail in one of these: The Objective-C Programming Languagehttp://developerapplecom/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Introduction/introObjectiveChtml Cocoa Fundamentals Guidehttps://developerapplecom/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaFundamentals/Introduction/Introductionhtml Coding Guidelines for Cocoahttps://developerapplecom/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/CodingGuidelineshtml iOS App Programming Guidehttp://developerapplecom/library/ios/documentation/iphone/conceptual/iphoneosprogrammingguide/Introduction/Introductionhtml Table of Contents Dot-Notation Syntaxdot-notation-syntax Spacingspacing

CGRect Functionscgrect-functions Constantsconstants Enumerated Typesenumerated-types Bitmasksbitmasks Private Propertiesprivate-properties Image Namingimage-naming Booleansbooleans Singletonssingletons Importsimports Xcode Projectxcode-project Dot-Notation SyntaxDot-notation should always be used for accessing and mutating properties Bracket notation is preferred in all other instancesFor example:objcviewbackgroundColor  UIColor orangeColorUIApplication sharedApplicationdelegateNot:objcview setBackgroundColor:UIColor orangeColorUIApplicationsharedApplicationdelegate Spacing Indent using 4 spaces Never indent with tabs Be sure to set this preference in Xcode Method braces and other braces if/else/switch/while etc always open on the same line as the statement but close on a new lineFor example:objcif userisHappy //Do somethingelse //Do something else There should be exactly one blank line between methods to aid in visual clarity and organization Whitespace within methods should separate functionality but often there should probably be new methods synthesize and dynamic should each be declared on new lines in the implementation ConditionalsConditional bodies should always use braces even when a conditional body could be written without braces eg it is one line only to prevent errorshttps://githubcom/NYTimes/objective-c-style-guide/issues/26issuecomment-22074256 These errors include adding a second line and expecting it to be part of the if-statement Another even more dangerous defecthttp://programmersstackexchangecom/a/16530 may happen where the line inside the if-statement is commented out and the next line unwittingly becomes part of the if-statement In addition this style is more consistent with all other conditionals and therefore more easily scannableFor example:objcif error     return successNot:objcif error    return successorobjcif error return success Ternary OperatorThe Ternary operator   should only be used when it increases clarity or code neatness A single condition is usually all that should be evaluated Evaluating multiple conditions is usually more understandable as an if statement or refactored into instance variablesFor example:objcresult  a  b  x : yNot:objcresult  a  b  x  c  d  c : d : y Error handlingWhen methods return an error parameter by reference switch on the returned value not the error variableFor example:objcNSError errorif self trySomethingWithError:error     // Handle ErrorNot:objcNSError errorself trySomethingWithError:errorif error     // Handle ErrorSome of Apples APIs write garbage values to the error parameter if non-NULL in successful cases so switching on the error can cause false negatives and subsequently crash MethodsIn method signatures there should be a space after the scope -/ symbol There should be a space between the method segmentsFor Example:objc- voidsetExampleText:NSString text image:UIImage image VariablesVariables should be named as descriptively as possible Single letter variable names should be avoided except in for loopsAsterisks indicating pointers belong with the variable eg NSString text not NSString text or NSString  text except in the case of constantsProperty definitions should be used in place of naked instance variables whenever possible Direct instance variable access should be avoided except in initializer methods init initWithCoder: etc dealloc methods and within custom setters and getters For more information on using Accessor Methods in Initializer Methods and dealloc see herehttps://developerapplecom/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/mmPracticalhtml//appleref/doc/uid/TP40004447-SW6For example:objcinterface NYTSection: NSObjectproperty nonatomic NSString headlineendNot:objcinterface NYTSection : NSObject     NSString headline Variable QualifiersWhen it comes to the variable qualifiers introduced with ARChttps://developerapplecom/library/ios/releasenotes/objectivec/rn-transitioningtoarc/Introduction/Introductionhtml//appleref/doc/uid/TP40011226-CH1-SW4 the qualifier strong weak unsafeunretained autoreleasing should be placed between the asterisks and the variable name eg NSString  weak text  NamingApple naming conventions should be adhered to wherever possible especially those related to memory management ruleshttps://developerapplecom/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/MemoryMgmthtml NARChttp://stackoverflowcom/a/2865194/340508Long descriptive method and variable names are goodFor example:objcUIButton settingsButtonNotobjcUIButton setButA three letter prefix eg NYT should always be used for class names and constants however may be omitted for Core Data entity names Constants should be camel-case with all words capitalized and prefixed by the related class name for clarityFor example:objcstatic const NSTimeInterval NYTArticleViewControllerNavigationFadeAnimationDuration  03Not:objcstatic const NSTimeInterval fadetime  17Properties and local variables should be camel-case with the leading word being lowercaseInstance variables should be camel-case with the leading word being lowercase and should be prefixed with an underscore This is consistent with instance variables synthesized automatically by LLVM If LLVM can synthesize the variable automatically then let itFor example:objcsynthesize descriptiveVariableName  descriptiveVariableNameNot:objcid varnm CommentsWhen they are needed comments should be used to explain why a particular piece of code does something Any comments that are used must be kept up-to-date or deletedBlock comments should generally be avoided as code should be as self-documenting as possible with only the need for intermittent few-line explanations This does not apply to those comments used to generate documentation init and deallocdealloc methods should be placed at the top of the implementation directly after the synthesize and dynamic statements init should be placed directly below the dealloc methods of any classinit methods should be structured like this:objc- instancetypeinit     self  super init // or call the designated initializer    if self         // Custom initialization        return self LiteralsNSString NSDictionary NSArray and NSNumber literals should be used whenever creating immutable instances of those objects Pay special care that nil values not be passed into NSArray and NSDictionary literals as this will cause a crashFor example:objcNSArray names  Brian Matt Chris Alex Steve PaulNSDictionary productManagers  iPhone : Kate iPad : Kamal Mobile Web : BillNSNumber shouldUseLiterals  YESNSNumber buildingZIPCode  10018Not:objcNSArray names  NSArray arrayWithObjects:Brian Matt Chris Alex Steve Paul nilNSDictionary productManagers  NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys: Kate iPhone Kamal iPad Bill Mobile Web nilNSNumber shouldUseLiterals  NSNumber numberWithBool:YESNSNumber buildingZIPCode  NSNumber numberWithInteger:10018 CGRect FunctionsWhen accessing the x y width or height of a CGRect always use the CGGeometry functionshttp://developerapplecom/library/ios/documentation/graphicsimaging/reference/CGGeometry/Reference/referencehtml instead of direct struct member access From Apples CGGeometry reference: All functions described in this reference that take CGRect data structures as inputs implicitly standardize those rectangles before calculating their results For this reason your applications should avoid directly reading and writing the data stored in the CGRect data structure Instead use the functions described here to manipulate rectangles and to retrieve their characteristicsFor example:objcCGRect frame  selfviewframeCGFloat x  CGRectGetMinXframeCGFloat y  CGRectGetMinYframeCGFloat width  CGRectGetWidthframeCGFloat height  CGRectGetHeightframeNot:objcCGRect frame  selfviewframeCGFloat x  frameoriginxCGFloat y  frameoriginyCGFloat width  framesizewidthCGFloat height  framesizeheight ConstantsConstants are preferred over in-line string literals or numbers as they allow for easy reproduction of commonly used variables and can be quickly changed without the need for find and replace Constants should be declared as static constants and not defines unless explicitly being used as a macroFor example:objcstatic NSString  const NYTAboutViewControllerCompanyName  The New York Times Companystatic const CGFloat NYTImageThumbnailHeight  500Not:objcdefine CompanyName The New York Times Companydefine thumbnailHeight 2 Enumerated TypesWhen using enums it is recommended to use the new fixed underlying type specification because it has stronger type checking and code completion The SDK now includes a macro to facilitate and encourage use of fixed underlying types  NSENUMExample:objctypedef NSENUMNSInteger NYTAdRequestState     NYTAdRequestStateInactive    NYTAdRequestStateLoading BitmasksWhen working with bitmasks use the NSOPTIONS macroExample:objctypedef NSOPTIONSNSUInteger NYTAdCategory   NYTAdCategoryAutos       1  0  NYTAdCategoryJobs        1  1  NYTAdCategoryRealState   1  2  NYTAdCategoryTechnology  1  3 Private PropertiesPrivate properties should be declared in class extensions anonymous categories in the implementation file of a class Named categories such as NYTPrivate or private should never be used unless extending another classFor example:objcinterface NYTAdvertisement property nonatomic strong GADBannerView googleAdViewproperty nonatomic strong ADBannerView iAdViewproperty nonatomic strong UIWebView adXWebViewend Image NamingImage names should be named consistently to preserve organization and developer sanity They should be named as one camel case string with a description of their purpose followed by the un-prefixed name of the class or property they are customizing if there is one followed by a further description of color and/or placement and finally their stateFor example: RefreshBarButtonItem / RefreshBarButtonItem2x and RefreshBarButtonItemSelected / RefreshBarButtonItemSelected2x ArticleNavigationBarWhite / ArticleNavigationBarWhite2x and ArticleNavigationBarBlackSelected / ArticleNavigationBarBlackSelected2xImages that are used for a similar purpose should be grouped in respective groups in an Images folder BooleansSince nil resolves to NO it is unnecessary to compare it in conditions Never compare something directly to YES because YES is defined to 1 and a BOOL can be up to 8 bitsThis allows for more consistency across files and greater visual clarityFor example:objcif someObject Not:objcif someObject  nil -----For a BOOL here are two examples:objcif isAwesomeif someObject boolValueNot:objcif isAwesome  YES // Never do thisif someObject boolValue  NO-----If the name of a BOOL property is expressed as an adjective the property can omit the is prefix but specifies the conventional name for the get accessor for example:objcproperty assign getterisEditable BOOL editableText and example taken from the Cocoa Naming Guidelineshttps://developerapplecom/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/Articles/NamingIvarsAndTypeshtml//appleref/doc/uid/20001284-BAJGIIJE SingletonsSingleton objects should use a thread-safe pattern for creating their shared instanceobjc instancetypesharedInstance    static id sharedInstance  nil   static dispatchoncet onceToken   dispatchonceonceToken

there is more than one import statement group the statements togetherhttp://ashfurrowcom/blog/structuring-modern-objective-c Commenting each group is optionalNote: For modules use the

should be kept in sync with the Xcode project files in order to avoid file sprawl Any Xcode groups created should be reflected by folders in the filesystem Code should be grouped not only by type but also by feature for greater clarityWhen possible always turn on Treat Warnings as Errors in the targets Build Settings and enable as many additional warningshttp://boredzoorg/blog/archives/2009-11-07/warnings as possible If you need to ignore a specific warning use Clangs pragma

120,0.0,gscott1967/datasharing,DOCS,gscott1967,datasharing,1.0,The Leek group guide to data sharing ,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,72.0,How to share data with a statisticianThis is a guide for anyone who needs to share data with a statistician The target audiences I have in mind are: Scientific collaborators who need statisticians to analyze data for them Students or postdocs in scientific disciplines looking for consulting advice Junior statistics students whose job it is to collate/clean data setsThe goals of this guide are to provide some instruction on the best way to share data to avoid the most common pitfallsand sources of delay in the transition from data collection to data analysis The Leek grouphttp://biostatjhsphedu/jleek/ works with a largenumber of collaborators and the number one source of variation in the speed to results is the status of the datawhen they arrive at the Leek group Based on my conversations with other statisticians this is true nearly universallyMy strong feeling is that statisticians should be able to handle the data in whatever state they arrive It is importantto see the raw data understand the steps in the processing pipeline and be able to incorporate hidden sources ofvariability in ones data analysis On the other hand for many data types the processing steps are well documentedand standardized So the work of converting the data from raw form to directly analyzable form can be performed before calling on a statistician This can dramatically speed the turnaround time since the statistician doesnthave to work through all the pre-processing steps first What you should deliver to the statisticianFor maximum speed in the analysis this is the information you should pass to a statistician:1 The raw data2 A tidy data sethttp://vitahadconz/papers/tidy-datapdf 3 A code book describing each variable and its values in the tidy data set  4 An explicit and exact recipe you used to go from 1 - 23 Lets look at each part of the data package you will transfer  The raw dataIt is critical that you include the rawest form of the data that you have access to Here are some examples of theraw form of data: The strange binary filehttp://enwikipediaorg/wiki/Binaryfile your measurement machine spits out The unformatted Excel file with 10 worksheets the company you contracted with sent you The complicated JSONhttp://enwikipediaorg/wiki/JSON data you got from scraping the Twitter APIhttps://twittercom/twitterapi The hand-entered numbers you collected looking through a microscopeYou know the raw data is in the right format if you: 1 Ran no software on the data1 Did not manipulate any of the numbers in the data1 You did not remove any data from the data set1 You did not summarize the data in any wayIf you did any manipulation of the data at all it is not the raw form of the data Reporting manipulated dataas raw data is a very common way to slow down the analysis process since the analyst will often have to do aforensic study of your data to figure out why the raw data looks weird  The tidy data setThe general principles of tidy data are laid out by Hadley Wickhamhttp://hadconz/ in this paperhttp://vitahadconz/papers/tidy-datapdfand this videohttp://vimeocom/33727555 The paper and the video are both focused on the Rhttp://wwwr-projectorg/ package which youmay or may not know how to use Regardless the four general principles you should pay attention to are:1 Each variable you measure should be in one column1 Each different observation of that variable should be in a different row1 There should be one table for each kind of variable1 If you have multiple tables they should include a column in the table that allows them to be linkedWhile these are the hard and fast rules there are a number of other things that will make your data set much easierto handle First is to include a row at the top of each data table/spreadsheet that contains full row names So if you measured age at diagnosis for patients you would head that column with the name AgeAtDiagnosis insteadof something like ADx or another abbreviation that may be hard for another person to understand Here is an example of how this would work from genomics Suppose that for 20 people you have collected gene expression measurements with RNA-sequencinghttp://enwikipediaorg/wiki/RNA-Seq You have also collected demographic and clinical informationabout the patients including their age treatment and diagnosis You would have one table/spreadsheet that contains the clinical/demographicinformation It would have four columns patient id age treatment diagnosis and 21 rows a row with variable names then one rowfor every patient You would also have one spreadsheet for the summarized genomic data Usually this type of datais summarized at the level of the number of counts per exon Suppose you have 100000 exons then you would have atable/spreadsheet that had 21 rows a row for gene names and one row for each patient and 100001 columns one row for patientids and one row for each data type If you are sharing your data with the collaborator in Excel the tidy data should be in one Excel file per table Theyshould not have multiple worksheets no macros should be applied to the data and no columns/cells should be highlighted Alternatively share the data in a CSVhttp://enwikipediaorg/wiki/Comma-separatedvalues or TAB-delimitedhttp://enwikipediaorg/wiki/Tab-separatedvalues text file The code bookFor almost any data set the measurements you calculate will need to be described in more detail than you will sneakinto the spreadsheet The code book contains this information At minimum it should contain:1 Information about the variables including units in the data set not contained in the tidy data 1 Information about the summary choices you made1 Information about the experimental study design you usedIn our genomics example the analyst would want to know what the unit of measurement for eachclinical/demographic variable is age in years treatment by name/dose level of diagnosis and how heterogeneous They would also want to know how you picked the exons you used for summarizing the genomic data UCSC/Ensembl etc Theywould also want to know any other information about how you did the data collection/study design For exampleare these the first 20 patients that walked into the clinic Are they 20 highly selected patients by some characteristiclike age Are they randomized to treatments A common format for this document is a Word file There should be a section called Study design that has a thoroughdescription of how you collected the data There is a section called Code book that describes each variable and itsunits  How to code variablesWhen you put variables into a spreadsheet there are several main categories you will run into depending on their data typehttp://enwikipediaorg/wiki/Statisticaldatatype:1 Continuous1 Ordinal1 Categorical1 Missing 1 CensoredContinuous variables are anything measured on a quantitative scale that could be any fractional number An examplewould be something like weight measured in kg Ordinal datahttp://enwikipediaorg/wiki/Ordinaldata are data that have a fixed small  100 number of levels but are ordered This could be for example survey responses where the choices are: poor fair good Categorical datahttp://enwikipediaorg/wiki/Categoricalvariable are data where thereare multiple categories but they arent ordered One example would be sex: male or female Missing datahttp://enwikipediaorg/wiki/Missingdata are datathat are missing and you dont know the mechanism You should code missing values as NA Censored datahttp://enwikipediaorg/wiki/Censoringstatistics are datawhere you know the missingness mechanism on some level Common examples are a measurement being below a detection limitor a patient being lost to follow-up They should also be coded as NA when you dont have the data But you shouldalso add a new column to your tidy data called VariableNameCensored which should have values of TRUE if censored and FALSE if not In the code book you should explain why those values are missing It is absolutely critical to reportto the analyst if there is a reason you know about that some of the data are missing You should also not imputehttp://enwikipediaorg/wiki/Imputationstatistics/make up/throw away missing observationsIn general try to avoid coding categorical or ordinal variables as numbers When you enter the value for sex in the tidydata it should be male or female The ordinal values in the data set should be poor fair and good not 1 2 3This will avoid potential mixups about which direction effects go and will help identify coding errors Always encode every piece of information about your observations using text For example if you are storing data in Excel and use a form of colored text or cell background formatting to indicate information about an observation red variable entries were observed in experiment 1 then this information will not be exported and will be lost when the data is exported as raw text  Every piece of data should be encoded as actual text that can be exported   The instruction list/scriptYou may have heard this before but reproducibility is kind of a big deal in computational sciencehttp://wwwsciencemagorg/content/334/6060/1226That means when you submit your paper the reviewers and the rest of the world should be able to exactly replicatethe analyses from raw data all the way to final results If you are trying to be efficient you will likely performsome summarization/data analysis steps before the data can be considered tidy The ideal thing for you to do when performing summarization is to create a computer script in R Python or something else that takes the raw data as input and produces the tidy data you are sharing as output You can try running your scripta couple of times and see if the code produces the same output In many cases the person who collected the data has incentive to make it tidy for a statistician to speed the processof collaboration They may not know how to code in a scripting language In that case what you should provide the statisticianis something called pseudocodehttp://enwikipediaorg/wiki/Pseudocode It should look something like:1 Step 1 - take the raw file run version 312 of summarize software with parameters a1 b2 c31 Step 2 - run the software separately for each sample1 Step 3 - take column three of outputfileout for each sample and that is the corresponding row in the output data setYou should also include information about which system Mac/Windows/Linux you used the software on and whether you tried it more than once to confirm it gave the same results Ideally you will run this by a fellow student/labmateto confirm that they can obtain the same output file you did What you should expect from the analystWhen you turn over a properly tidied data set it dramatically decreases the workload on the statistician So hopefullythey will get back to you much sooner But most careful statisticians will check your recipe ask questions aboutsteps you performed and try to confirm that they can obtain the same tidy data that you did with at minimum spotchecksYou should then expect from the statistician:1 An analysis script that performs each of the analyses not just instructions1 The exact computer code they used to run the analysis1 All output files/figures they generated This is the information you will use in the supplement to establish reproducibility and precision of your results Eachof the steps in the analysis should be clearly explained and you should ask questions when you dont understandwhat the analyst did It is the responsibility of both the statistician and the scientist to understand the statisticalanalysis You may not be able to perform the exact analyses

selection of notes and tips on using the command-line that weve found useful when working on Linux Some tips are elementary and some are fairly specific sophisticated or obscure This page is not long but if you can use and recall all the items here you know a lotThis work is the result of many authors and translatorsAUTHORSmdMuch of thisoriginallyhttp://wwwquoracom/What-are-some-lesser-known-but-useful-Unix-commandsappearedhttp://wwwquoracom/What-are-the-most-useful-Swiss-army-knife-one-liners-on-Unixon Quorahttp://wwwquoracom/What-are-some-time-saving-tips-that-every-Linux-user-should-knowbut given the interest there it seemed worth using GitHub where people more talented than the original author could readily suggest improvements If you see an error or something that could be better please submit an issue or PR Of course please review the meta section and existing PRs/issues first MetaScope:- This guide is both for beginners and the experienced The goals are breadth everything important specificity give concrete examples of the most common case and brevity avoid things that arent essential or digressions you can easily look up elsewhere Every tip is essential in some situation or significantly saves time over alternatives- This is written for Linux with the exception of the MacOS X onlymacos-x-only section Many of the other items apply or can be installed on other Unices or MacOS or even Cygwin- The focus is on interactive Bash though many tips apply to other shells and to general Bash scripting- It includes both standard Unix commands as well as ones that require special package installs -- so long as they are important enough to merit inclusionNotes:- To keep this to one page content is implicitly included by reference Youre smart enough to look up more detail elsewhere once you know the idea or command to Google Use apt-get/yum/dnf/pacman/pip/brew as appropriate to install new programs- Use Explainshellhttp://explainshellcom/ to get a helpful breakdown of what commands options pipes etc do Basics- Learn basic Bash Actually type man bash and at least skim the whole thing its pretty easy to follow and not that long Alternate shells can be nice but Bash is powerful and always available learning only zsh fish etc while tempting on your own laptop restricts you in many situations such as using existing servers- Learn at least one text-based editor well Ideally Vim vi as theres really no competition for random editing in a terminal even if you use Emacs a big IDE or a modern hipster editor most of the time- Know how to read documentation with man for the inquisitive man man lists the section numbers eg 1 is regular commands 5 is files/conventions and 8 are for administration Find man pages with apropos Know that some commands are not executables but Bash builtins and that you can get help on them with help and help -d- Learn about redirection of output and input using  and  and pipes using  Know  overwrites the output file and  appends Learn about stdout and stderr- Learn about file glob expansion with  and perhaps  and  and quoting and the difference between double  and single  quotes See more on variable expansion below- Be familiar with Bash job management:  ctrl-z ctrl-c jobs fg bg kill etc- Know ssh and the basics of passwordless authentication via ssh-agent ssh-add etc- Basic file management: ls and ls -l in particular learn what every column in ls -l means less head tail and tail -f or even better less F ln and ln -s learn the differences and advantages of hard versus soft links chown chmod du for a quick summary of disk usage: du -hs  For filesystem management df mount fdisk mkfs lsblk Learn what an inode is ls -i or df -i- Basic network management: ip or ifconfig dig- Know regular expressions well and the various flags to grep/egrep The -i -o -v -A -B and -C options are worth knowing- Learn to use apt-get yum dnf or pacman depending on distro to find and install packages And make sure you have pip to install Python-based command-line tools a few below are easiest to install via pip Everyday use- In Bash use Tab to complete arguments or list all available commands and ctrl-r to search through command history after pressing type to search press ctrl-r repeatedly to cycle through more matches press Enter to execute the found command or hit the right arrow to put the result in the current line to allow editing- In Bash use ctrl-w to delete the last word and ctrl-u to delete all the way back to the start of the line Use alt-b and alt-f to move by word ctrl-a to move cursor to beginning of line  ctrl-e to move cursor to end of line ctrl-k to kill to the end of the line ctrl-l to clear the screen See man readline for all the default keybindings in Bash There are a lot For example alt- cycles through previous arguments and alt- expands a glob- Alternatively if you love vi-style key-bindings use set -o vi and set -o emacs to put it back- For editing long commands after setting your editor for example export EDITORvim ctrl-x ctrl-e will open the current command in an editor for multi-line editing Or in vi style escape-v- To see recent commands history There are also many abbreviations such as  last argument and  last command though these are often easily replaced with ctrl-r and alt-- To go back to the previous working directory: cd -- If you are halfway through typing a command but change your mind hit alt- to add a  at the beginning and enter it as a comment or use ctrl-a  enter You can then return to it later via command history- Use xargs or parallel Its very powerful Note you can control how many items execute per line -L as well as parallelism -P If youre not sure if itll do the right thing use xargs echo first Also -I is handy Examples:bash      find  -name py  xargs grep somefunction      cat hosts  xargs -I ssh root hostname- pstree -p is a helpful display of the process tree- Use pgrep and pkill to find or signal processes by name -f is helpful- Know the various signals you can send processes For example to suspend a process use kill -STOP pid For the full list see man 7 signal- Use nohup or disown if you want a background process to keep running forever- Check what processes are listening via netstat -lntp or ss -plat for TCP add -u for UDP- See also lsof for open sockets and files- See uptime or w to know the how long the system has been running- Use alias to create shortcuts for commonly used commands For example alias llls -latr creates a new alias ll- In Bash scripts use set -x or the variant set -v which logs raw input including unexpanded variables and comments for debugging output Use strict modes unless you have a good reason not to: Use set -e to abort on errors nonzero exit code Use set -u to detect unset variable usages Consider set -o pipefail too to on errors within pipes too though read up on it more if you do as this topic is a bit subtle For more involved scripts also use trap on EXIT or ERR A useful habit is to start a script like this which will make it detect and abort on common errors and print a message:bash      set -euo pipefail      trap echo error: Script failed: see failed command above ERR- In Bash scripts subshells written with parentheses are convenient ways to group commands A common example is to temporarily move to a different working directory egbash       do something in current dir      cd /some/other/dir  other-command       continue in original dir- In Bash note there are lots of kinds of variable expansion Checking a variable exists: name:error message For example if a Bash script requires a single argument just write inputfile1:usage: 0 inputfile Arithmetic expansion: i i  1  5  Sequences: 110 Trimming of strings: varsuffix and varprefix For example if varfoopdf then echo varpdftxt prints footxt- Brace expansion using  can reduce having to re-type similar text and automate combinations of items  This is helpful in examples like mv footxtpdf some-dir which moves both files cp somefilebak which expands to cp somefile somefilebak or mkdir -p test-abc/subtest-123 which expands all possible combinations and creates a directory tree- The output of a command can be treated like a file via some command For example compare local /etc/hosts with a remote one:sh      diff /etc/hosts ssh somehost cat /etc/hosts- Know about here documents in Bash as in cat EOF - In Bash redirect both standard output and standard error via: some-command logfile 21 or some-command logfile Often to ensure a command does not leave an open file handle to standard input tying it to the terminal you are in it is also good practice to add /dev/null- Use man ascii for a good ASCII table with hex and decimal values For general encoding info man unicode man utf-8 and man latin1 are helpful- Use screen or tmuxhttps://tmuxgithubio/ to multiplex the screen especially useful on remote ssh sessions and to detach and re-attach to a session byobu can enhance screen or tmux providing more information and easier management A more minimal alternative for session persistence only is dtach- In ssh knowing how to port tunnel with -L or -D and occasionally -R is useful eg to access web sites from a remote server- It can be useful to make a few optimizations to your ssh configuration for example this /ssh/config contains settings to avoid dropped connections in certain network environments uses compression which is helpful with scp over low-bandwidth connections and multiplex channels to the same server with a local control file:      TCPKeepAliveyes      ServerAliveInterval15      ServerAliveCountMax6      Compressionyes      ControlMaster auto      ControlPath /tmp/rh:p      ControlPersist yes- A few other options relevant to ssh are security sensitive and should be enabled with care eg per subnet or host or in trusted networks: StrictHostKeyCheckingno ForwardAgentyes- Consider moshhttps://moshmitedu/ an alternative to ssh that uses UDP avoiding dropped connections and adding convenience on the road requires server-side setup- To get the permissions on a file in octal form which is useful for system configuration but not available in ls and easy to bungle use something likesh      stat -c A a n /etc/timezone- For interactive selection of values from the output of another command use percolhttps://githubcom/mooz/percol or fzfhttps://githubcom/junegunn/fzf- For interaction with files based on the output of another command like git use fpp PathPickerhttps://githubcom/facebook/PathPicker- For a simple web server for all files in the current directory and subdirs available to anyone on your network use:python -m SimpleHTTPServer 7777 for port 7777 and Python 2 and python -m httpserver 7777 for port 7777 and Python 3- For running a command with privileges use sudo for root or sudo -u for another user Use su or sudo bash to actually run a shell as that user Use su - to simulate a fresh login as root or another user Processing files and data- To locate a file by name in the current directory find  -iname something or similar To find a file anywhere by name use locate something but bear in mind updatedb may not have indexed recently created files- For general searching through source or data files more advanced than grep -r use aghttps://githubcom/ggreer/thesilversearcher- To convert HTML to text: lynx -dump -stdin- For Markdown HTML and all kinds of document conversion try pandochttp://pandocorg/- If you must handle XML xmlstarlet is old but good- For JSON use jqhttp://stedolangithubio/jq/- For YAML use shyamlhttps://githubcom/0k/shyaml- For Excel or CSV files csvkithttps://githubcom/onyxfish/csvkit provides in2csv csvcut csvjoin csvgrep etc- For Amazon S3 s3cmdhttps://githubcom/s3tools/s3cmd is convenient and s4cmdhttps://githubcom/bloomreach/s4cmd is faster Amazons awshttps://githubcom/aws/aws-cli and the improved sawshttps://githubcom/donnemartin/saws are essential for other AWS-related tasks- Know about sort and uniq including uniqs -u and -d options -- see one-liners below See also comm- Know about cut paste and join to manipulate text files Many people use cut but forget about join- Know about wc to count newlines -l characters -m words -w and bytes -c- Know about tee to copy from stdin to a file and also to stdout as in ls -al  tee filetxt- Know that locale affects a lot of command line tools in subtle ways including sorting order collation and performance Most Linux installations will set LANG or other locale variables to a local setting like US English But be aware sorting will change if you change locale And know i18n routines can make sort or other commands run many times slower In some situations such as the set operations or uniqueness operations below you can safely ignore slow i18n routines entirely and use traditional byte-based sort order using export LCALLC- Know basic awk and sed for simple data munging For example summing all numbers in the third column of a text file: awk  x  3  END  print x  This is probably 3X faster and 3X shorter than equivalent Python- To replace all occurrences of a string in place in one or more files:sh      perl -pibak -e s/old-string/new-string/g my-files-txt- To rename multiple files and/or search and replace within files try reprenhttps://githubcom/jlevy/repren In some cases the rename command also allows multiple renames but be careful as its functionality is not the same on all Linux distributionssh       Full rename of filenames directories and contents foo - bar:      repren --full --preserve-case --from foo --to bar        Recover backup files whateverbak - whatever:      repren --renames --from bak --to 1 bak       Same as above using rename if available:      rename s/bak// bak- As the man page says rsync really is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool Its known for synchronizing between machines but is equally useful locally It also is among the fastest wayshttps://webarchiveorg/web/20130929001850/http://linuxnotenet/jianingy/en/linux/a-fast-way-to-remove-huge-number-of-fileshtml to delete large numbers of files:shmkdir empty  rsync -r --delete empty/ some-dir  rmdir some-dir- Use shuf to shuffle or select random lines from a file- Know sorts options For numbers use -n or -h for handling human-readable numbers eg from du -h Know how keys work -t and -k In particular watch out that you need to write -k11 to sort by only the first field -k1 means sort according to the whole line Stable sort sort -s can be useful For example to sort first by field 2 then secondarily by field 1 you can use sort -k11  sort -s -k22- If you ever need to write a tab literal in a command line in Bash eg for the -t argument to sort press ctrl-v Tab or write t the latter is better as you can copy/paste it- The standard tools for patching source code are diff and patch See also diffstat for summary statistics of a diff and sdiff for a side-by-side diff Note diff -r works for entire directories Use diff -r tree1 tree2  diffstat for a summary of changes Use vimdiff to compare and edit files- For binary files use hd hexdump or xxd for simple hex dumps and bvi or biew for binary editing- Also for binary files strings plus grep etc lets you find bits of text- For binary diffs delta compression use xdelta3- To convert text encodings try iconv Or uconv for more advanced use it supports some advanced Unicode things For example this command lowercases and removes all accents by expanding and dropping them:sh      uconv -f utf-8 -t utf-8 -x ::Any-Lower ::Any-NFD :Nonspacing Mark:  ::Any-NFC   inputtxt  outputtxt- To split files into pieces see split to split by size and csplit to split by a pattern- To manipulate date and time expressions use dateadd datediff strptime etc from dateutilshttp://wwwfresseorg/dateutils/- Use zless zmore zcat and zgrep to operate on compressed files System debugging- For web debugging curl and curl -I are handy or their wget equivalents or the more modern httpiehttps://githubcom/jkbrzt/httpie- To know current cpu/disk status the classic tools are top or the better htop iostat and iotop Use iostat -mxz 15 for basic CPU and detailed per-partition disk stats and performance insight- For network connection details use netstat and ss- For a quick overview of whats happening on a system dstat is especially useful For broadest overview with details use glanceshttps://githubcom/nicolargo/glances- To know memory status run and understand the output of free and vmstat In particular be aware the cached value is memory held by the Linux kernel as file cache so effectively counts toward the free value- Java system debugging is a different kettle of fish but a simple trick on Oracles and some other JVMs is that you can run kill -3 pid and a full stack trace and heap summary including generational garbage collection details which can be highly informative will be dumped to stderr/logs The JDKs jps jstat jstack jmap are useful SJK toolshttps://githubcom/aragozin/jvm-tools are more advanced- Use mtr as a better traceroute to identify network issues- For looking at why a disk is full ncdu saves time over the usual commands like du -sh - To find which socket or process is using bandwidth try iftop or nethogs- The ab tool comes with Apache is helpful for quick-and-dirty checking of web server performance For more complex load testing try siege- For more serious network debugging wireshark tshark or ngrep- Know about strace and ltrace These can be helpful if a program is failing hanging or crashing and you dont know why or if you want to get a general idea of performance Note the profiling option -c and the ability to attach to a running process -p- Know about ldd to check shared libraries etc- Know how to connect to a running process with gdb and get its stack traces- Use /proc Its amazingly helpful sometimes when debugging live problems Examples: /proc/cpuinfo /proc/meminfo /proc/cmdline /proc/xxx/cwd /proc/xxx/exe /proc/xxx/fd/ /proc/xxx/smaps where xxx is the process id or pid- When debugging why something went wrong in the past sar can be very helpful It shows historic statistics on CPU memory network etc- For deeper systems and performance analyses look at stap SystemTaphttps://sourcewareorg/systemtap/wiki perfhttps://enwikipediaorg/wiki/PerfLinux and sysdighttps://githubcom/draios/sysdig- Check what OS youre on with uname or uname -a general Unix/kernel info or lsbrelease -a Linux distro info- Use dmesg whenever somethings acting really funny it could be hardware or driver issues One-linersA few examples of piecing together commands:- It is remarkably helpful sometimes that you can do set intersection union and difference of text files via sort/uniq Suppose a and b are text files that are already uniqued This is fast and works on files of arbitrary size up to many gigabytes Sort is not limited by memory though you may need to use the -T option if /tmp is on a small root partition See also the note about LCALL above and sorts -u option left out for clarity belowsh      cat a b  sort  uniq  c    c is a union b      cat a b  sort  uniq -d  c    c is a intersect b      cat a b b  sort  uniq -u  c    c is set difference a - b- Use grep   to quickly examine the contents of all files in a directory so each line is paired with the filename or head -100  so each file has a heading This can be useful for directories filled with config settings like those in /sys /proc /etc- Summing all numbers in the third column of a text file this is probably 3X faster and 3X less code than equivalent Python:sh      awk  x  3  END  print x  myfile- If want to see sizes/dates on a tree of files this is like a recursive ls -l but is easier to read than ls -lR:sh      find  -type f -ls- Say you have a text file like a web server log and a certain value that appears on some lines such as an acctid parameter that is present in the URL If you want a tally of how many requests for each acctid:sh      cat accesslog  egrep -o acctid0-9  cut -d -f2  sort  uniq -c  sort -rn- To continuously monitor changes use watch eg check changes to files in a directory with watch -d -n 2 ls -rtlh  tail or to network settings while troubleshooting your wifi settings with watch -d -n 2 ifconfig- Run this function to get a random tip from this document parses Markdown and extracts an item:sh      function taocl         curl -s

commands for example ps ls tail awk sed have many subtle variations from Linux which is largely influenced by System V-style Unix and GNU tools You can often tell the difference by noting a man page has the heading BSD General Commands Manual In some cases GNU versions can be installed too such as gawk and gsed for GNU awk and sed If writing cross-platform Bash scripts avoid such commands for

project idea right now there is no implementation nor business modelMethod: a crash between:- Stack Overflow gamification- GitHub-like pull requests Not anyone can edit anything like Wikipedia madness but you can make your own copy fork and a precise a suggestion- Wikipedia Imagine if you could link up-votable application examples to the page of a Mathematics theorem- page rank-like algorithm for user reputation including a per-tag reputation which user knows more about mathematics and content recommendation what are the best articles about a given subjectVery early stage prototypes:- https://githubcom/cirosantilli/free-books-django-raw IntroConsider a Stack-Overflow-like QA website:- there are questions and answers- questions have tags eg programming languages like C C Java- users have a reputation measure If you upvote someones question or answer his reputation increases You need 15 reputation to upvote someoneBut Stack Overflows reputation system sucks because:- it the living ultimate god of C upvotes you you get 10 reputation- if the first-day newb of Java upvotes you you also get 10 reputationWe want to improve Stack Overflows simplistic linear reputation system to determine who is the user who knows the most about a given tagFundamental requirement: a Google PageRank-like algorithm Eigenvalue based such that:-   everyone has one reputation per tag-   if someone with high rep on a given tag upvotes you you get a lot of reputation on that tag More than you would get from someone with low reputation on that tagOptional but very desirable requirements:-   users can upvote tags on a given question to say: I agree that this question deserves this tag    The vote of users with higher rep on the tag should count more-   each time you upvote the same given person it has less positive impact on his reputation for that tag    This would counter voting fraud eg of close groups of friends which upvote each other a lotAnother problem this would solve: multiple site split silliness: http://metastackoverflowcom/questions/271989/does-it-pay-to-spin-off-sites Since there is no human moderation only algorithms splitting websites makes no sense Extra problems Original research vs explanationsHow to determine if something is original research or notEg: a genius discovers something and publishes it really badly explainedSomeone less intelligent comes explains it better and gets widely readOr someone who just posts a bunch of links to good sources Post agePost metrics on Stack Overflow also suck: the post with most upvotes goes up and that is itIt would be cool to give a boost to recent posts that got lots of upvotesThey cant beat the older ones in total upvotes but the upvote rate is a strong indicator of quality-

given tags / all tagsMaybe this is required Eg given a real network a bot network could make an exact copy of it and that should have the same reputation as the real oneSuch relations make per-user score of other users / posts even more important Per user score of all other usersRate how much one user likes other users based on his actionsEg: someone who only upvotes C questions will give score 0 for someone with only Java questions Tag duplicatesHow to mark tags java and Java as being duplicates without moderatorsPossible solution: everyone can mark tags as duplicateOnce you mark tags as duplicate if you search for one you will see both Pull request disagreementsWhat happens if:- the writter of an answer dies and someone makes a great pull request to his answer with 1M upvotes- 50 of users agree with a pull request 50 dontPossible solution:- next to each answer have a list of forks- everyone can mark an answer as the best version or just upvote the pull requests Testing: a difficultyWhile it is possible to download all public data from Stack overflow in dumps this algorithms would need private information like who upvoted whatSo generating meaningful test data would be

animation:javascript// Back to topcontaineronclick back-to-top function e   epreventDefault  html bodyanimatescrollTop: 0 800html-- Create an anchor tag --div classcontainer  a href classback-to-topBack to top/a/divChanging the scrollTop value changes where you wants the scrollbar to land All youre really doing is animating the body of the document throughout the course of 800 milliseconds until it scrolls to the top of the documentNote: Watch for some buggy behaviorhttps://githubcom/jquery/apijquerycom/issues/417 with scrollTopsupback to table of contentstable-of-contents/sup Preload ImagesIf your web page uses a lot of images that arent visible initially eg on hover it makes sense to preload them:javascriptpreloadImages  function    for var i  0 i  argumentslength i     imgattrsrc argumentsi  preloadImagesimg/hover-onpng img/hover-offpngsupback to table of contentstable-of-contents/sup Checking If Images Are LoadedSometimes you might need to check if your images have fully loaded in order to continue on with your scripts:javascriptimgonload function    consolelogimage load successfulYou can also check if one particular image has loaded by replacing the img tag with an ID or classsupback to table of contentstable-of-contents/sup Fix Broken Images AutomaticallyIf you happen to find broken image links on your site replacing them one by one can be a pain This simple piece of code can save a lot of headaches:javascriptimgonerror function    ifthishasClassbroken-image     thispropsrc img/brokenpngaddClassbroken-image  Alternatively if you wish to simply hide broken images this snippet will take care of that for:javascriptimgonerror function    thishidesupback to table of contentstable-of-contents/sup Post a Form with AJAXjQuery AJAX methods are a common way to request text HTML XML or JSON If you wanted to send a form via AJAX you could collect the user inputs via the val method:javascriptpostsignupphp   username: inputnameusernameval  email:     inputnameemailval  password:  inputnamepasswordvalHowever all of those val calls are expensive A better way of collecting the user inputs is using the serialize function which collects the user inputs as a string:javascriptpostsignup sign-up-formserializesupback to table of contentstable-of-contents/sup Toggle Classes on HoverLets say you want to change the visual of a clickable element on your page when a user hovers over it You can add a class to your element when the user is hovering when the user stops hovering removes the class:javascriptbtnonhover function    thisaddClasshover function    thisremoveClasshoverYou just need to add the necessary CSS If you want an even simpler way use the toggleClass method:javascriptbtnonhover function    thistoggleClasshoverNote: CSS may be a faster solution in this case but its still worthwhile to know thissupback to table of contentstable-of-contents/sup Disabling Input FieldsAt times you may want the submit button of a form or one of its text inputs to be disabled until the user has performed a certain action eg checking the Ive read the terms checkbox Add the disabled attribute to your input so you can enable it when you want:javascriptinputtypesubmitpropdisabled trueAll you need to do is run the prop method again on the input but set the value of disabled to false:javascriptinputtypesubmitpropdisabled falsesupback to table of contentstable-of-contents/sup Stop the Loading of LinksSometimes you dont want links to go to a certain web page nor reload the page you might want them to do something else like trigger some other script This will do the trick of preventing the default action:javascriptano-linkonclick function e   epreventDefaultsupback to table of contentstable-of-contents/sup Cache jQuery SelectorsThink of how many times you write the same selector over and over again in any project Every element selector has to search the entire DOM each time regardless if that selector had previously run Instead run the selector once and store the results in a variable:javascriptvar blocks  blocksfindliNow you can use the blocks variable wherever you want without having to search the DOM every time:javascripthideBlocksonclick function    blocksfadeOutshowBlocksonclick function    blocksfadeInCaching jQuery selectors are an easy performance gainsupback to table of contentstable-of-contents/sup Toggle Fade/SlideSliding and fading are something we use plenty in our animations with jQuery You might just want to show an element when a user clicks something which makes the fadeIn and slideDown methods perfect But if you want that element to appear on the first click and then disappear on the second this will work just fine:javascript// Fadebtnonclick function    elementfadeToggleslow// Togglebtnonclick function    elementslideToggleslowsupback to table of contentstable-of-contents/sup Simple AccordionThis is a simple method for a quick accordion:javascript// Close all panelsaccordionfindcontenthide// Accordionaccordionfindaccordion-headeronclick function    var next  thisnext  nextslideTogglefast  contentnotnextslideUpfast  return falseBy adding this script all you really needs to do on your web page is the necessary HTML go get this workingsupback to table of contentstable-of-contents/sup Make Two Divs the Same HeightSometimes youll want two divs to have the same height no matter what content they have in them:javascriptdivcssmin-height main-divheightThis example sets the min-height which means that it can be bigger than the main div but never smaller However a more flexible method would be to loop over a set of elements and set the height to the height of the tallest element:javascriptvar columns  columnvar height  0columnseachfunction    if thisheight  height     height  thisheight  columnsheightheightIf you want all columns to have the same height:javascriptvar rows  same-height-columnsrowseachfunction    thisfindcolumnheightthisheightNote: This can be done several ways in CSShttp://codepenio/AllThingsSmitty/pen/KMPqoO but depending on what your needs are knowing how to do this in jQuery is still worthwhilesupback to table of contentstable-of-contents/sup Open External Links in New Tab/WindowOpen external links in a new browser tab or window and ensure

IE10 This fixhttp://tosbourncom/a-fix-for-window-location-origin-in-internet-explorer/ takes care of the issuesupback to table of contentstable-of-contents/sup Find Element By TextBy using the contains selector in jQuery you can find text in content of an element If text doesnt exists that element will be hidden:javascriptvar search  searchvaldiv:not:contains  search  hidesupback to table

Error HandlingWhen an Ajax call returns a 404 or 500 error the error handler will be executed If the handler isnt defined other jQuery code might not work anymore Define a global Ajax error

calls to mitigate the process of repeatedly querying the DOM and creating multiple jQuery objects Lets say the following snippet represents your plugin method calls:javascriptelemshowelemhtmlblaelemotherStuffThis could be vastly improved by using chaining:javascriptelem  show  htmlbla  otherStuffAn alternative is to cache the element in a variable prefixed with :javascriptvar elem  elemelemhideelemhtmlblaelemotherStuffBoth chaining and cachingcache-jquery-selectors methods in jQuery are best practices that lead to shorter and faster codesupback to table

science a queue is a particular kind of abstract data type or collection in which the entities in the collection are kept in order and the principal or only operations on the collection are the addition of entities to the rear terminal position known as enqueue and removal of entities from the front terminal position known as dequeueWe all should have learned how queues work before But today we are considering a queue in the real world instead of a queue in computer science There are n people queueing up for the tickets of the ADA course numbered from 1 to n respectively Since the ADA course is very popular some of them may even fight for a better place in the queueThe fights in the ADA course is very special When person i is fighting against person j person i wins if and only if cijijemodpp2 where cep are numbers predefined by TAs We say a queue is stable if the first person in the queue can beat the second person in the queue the second person can beat the third and so on Please help us arrange a stable queue Input FormatThe first line contains an integer T indicating the total number of test cases Each test case contains four integers ncep in one line 1T10 2n200000

The condition n100000 holds for the first 10 tests 2 Lucky Number Time Limit: 1s DescriptionWe all know that digit 7 is lucky and digit 4 is unlucky For example you can win a jackpot if you get 777 on a casino slot machine and elevators often be missing the 4th floor or any floor whose number contains the digit 4 Even a special term Tetraphobia is created to describe the fear of the digit 4In this problem we say an integer n is a lucky number if: The integer n is divisible by 7 The decimal representation of n contains at least three digits 7 The decimal representation of n contains more digits 7 than digits 4For example 777 and 774746 are lucky numbers but 7771 77 and 747474 are not Can you tell us how many lucky numbers are in range lr Input FormatThe first line contains an integer T

problem The condition T300 holds for the first 10 tests 3 Rabbit House Time Limit: 1s DescriptionKokoa is a coffee shop clerk of Rabbit House Since Rabbit House is a famous coffee shop it earns lots of money per day Kokoa records the total income si everyday and checks whether it matches the cash Rabbit House has now To prevent malicious modification she also records ci which is the checksum of siAs a normal high school girl she doesnt know the complicate message digest algorithms like MD5 or SHA-1 Instead she just calculate the digit sums of si The digit sum of a given integer is the sum of all its digits For example if s30210002011 the checksums will be c514But this algorithm is too naive Its easy to construct a different s with same checksums For instance if s51013 the checksums will also be c514 To show how unreliable is digit sum please construct a valid s for a given c such that the last element of s is as small as possible If there are more than one possible s choose the one with smallest sn1 where n is the length of s If there are still more than one possible s choose the one with smallest sn2 and so on Input FormatThe first line contains an integer T indicating the total number of test cases Each test case starts with an integer n in one line indicating the number of days followed by a line of n integers c1c2cn 1T10 1nci1000 Output FormatFor each test case

HyperHacker city This city is known for its beautiful urban design To simplify this problem we treat HyperHacker city as an undirected graph G1G1HugeHammer the lazy and evil urban designer of HappyHippo City is too lazy to create his own design He decides to just copy HanHans design and randomly rename the vertices in the graph We call the renamed graph G2G2To simplify this problem again we assume that the vertices of G1G1 and G2G2 are labelled as 12n12n The renaming can be viewed as a random permutation  of 12n12n so an edge uvuv in G1G1 would be an edge uvuv in G2G2For example if there are three vertices and two edges in G1G1 and G2G2 The edges in G1G1 are 1212 and 2323 The edges in G2G2 are 2323 and 1313 A possible permutation is 132132 Since we can map edge 1212 in G1G1 to 12131213 in G2G2 and 2323 in G1G1 to 23322332 in G2G2 Note that the graphs are undirected so 2323 and 3232 are interchangeablePlease help HanHan to find the permutation  as the evidence of plagiarism Input FormatThe first line contains an integer TT indicating the total number of test cases Each test case starts with a line containing two integers nmnm denoting the number of nodes and edges in the undirected graphs G1G2G1G2 Each the following mm lines contains two integers aibiaibi denoting an edge aibiaibi in G1G1 Each the following mm lines contains two integers cidicidi denoting an edge cidicidi in G2G2 1T101T10 3n100003n10000 0m1000000m100000 1aibicidin1aibicidin There be self-loops and/or multi-edges in the graphs Output FormatFor each test case please output the permutation  in one line as 12n12n separated by a space If there are more than one possible permutation you can output any one of them Sample Input33 21 22 32 31 33 31 22 33 11 33 21 23 31 12 33 22 23 11 3 Sample

contains rules that will prevent the non-functional /dev/input/js and /dev/input/event devices from being used by removing read/write permissions from themThis is just a blacklist which will always be incomplete until the actual bug gets fixed Feel free to add more devices to this list How to install Version that changes permissions to 0000    sudo curl -o

usePersonally Id try the first version that sets permissions to 0000 first If it does not work or if it gives trouble for some reason Id try the second version that removes the deviceThe first version that sets permissions to 0000 seems to work fine across several distros but some distros such as OSMChttps://githubcom/denilsonsa/udev-joystick-blacklist/issues/5issuecomment-151872841 may have additional rules that end up setting the permssions back to another value In such case the second version that removes the device should workIn the end its up to you and its about what works best for you and your system How it works MatchingA rule will match if: The subsystem is input The pair idVendor and idProduct is in this list Either one of:     The device property IDINPUTJOYSTICK is set     Or the device name matches js0-9 ActionsThe following actions are taken on each matching rule: Clears IDINPUTJOYSTICK property which prevents some /lib/udev/rulesd/ rules from runninghttps://githubcom/denilsonsa/udev-joystick-blacklist/issues/5issuecomment-151832071 Depending on which version you installed:     Removes read and write permissions by setting MODE0000https://enwikipediaorg/wiki/FilesystempermissionsNumericnotation This effectively prevents the device from being used     Removes the device file from /dev/input/ This also prevents the device

devicesFor the complete list look at generaterulespygeneraterulespy script A4 Tech mouse and/or keyboard Microsoft mouse and/or keyboard Wacom tablets Cooler Master mouse ContributingThe best ways to contribute are by creating a new issueissues or by making a pull requestforking Make sure you mention the device name/description and the vendor/product IDs The relevant line from lsusb output is usually enoughThis repository contains a list of devices compiled from contributions of several people I cannot test every single device If something does not work for you even after you have added the correct rules please try debugging it on your own system The output of udevadm monitor -p may prove very helpful Also look at the output of ls -l /dev/input/ History of this repositoryAfter suffering with this issue for a long time I decided to investigate possible fixes and workarounds Then in May 2015 after searching a lot for a solution Ive managed to create some udev rules that fixed the issue for my devices and decided to share this solution with other people Initially I shared the simple file at GitHub Gistgist Over time people submitted contributions through comments and keeping that file on Gist was becoming too hard to manageIn October 2015 I decided to move the file to this GitHub repositorygithub That way it will be easier to make changes to fork to receive notifications and essentially to maintain itIdeally the bug in the Linux kernel should be fixed so that this repository which is essentially just a workaround wouldnt be needed anymore LicensePublic domain Feel free to use this project for whatever purpose you wantAlso feel free to contribute to the project And if you have the knowledge and the skills consider fixing this bug in the Linux kernel itselfThere is no warranty implied by using this project Use at your own riskgist: https://gistgithubcom/denilsonsa/978f1d842cf5430f57f6github:

git is the source control that we use to manage changes to the website Itcomes preinstalled on most Linux systems If you dont already have it justrunsudo apt-get install git-coreFor more information about what a typical git workflow for contributing tothe site might look like check out the curriculum from the WiCS gitworkshophttps://githubcom/wics-uw/git-workshop-W16/wiki and this OpenHatchdocumenthttp://openhatchreadthedocsorg/en/latest/advanced/workingwithgithtmlYou can also look into completing the OpenHatch git trainingmissionhttp://openhatchorg/missions/git pelican The easiest way to install Pelican is to create a virtualenv To do sofirst ensure that virtualenv is installed:sudo apt-get install python-virtualenvNow you can create a virtualenv:mkdir -p /virtualenvs/pelicancd /virtualenvs/pelicanvirtualenv source bin/activateYour shell prompt will change slightly like this:userhonk /virtualenvs/pelican  source bin/activatepelicanuserhonk /virtualenvs/pelican Now you can install Pelican by typingpip install pelican markdownIf you ever need to re-enable the virtualenv simply runsource /virtualenvs/pelican/bin/activate Setup Before you get started with development were going to walk through some setupsteps Cloning your repository Only complete this step onceYoull need to fork a copy of this repo in order to contribute To do so clickthe Fork button in the upper right hand cornerOne the project is forked youll be taken to your very own local copy of theWiCS website perhaps at https://githubcom/your-username/website This isyour personal remote repository on GitHub or what well call originNext youll need a folder to store the code in On Linux use the command lineto create a new directory and navigate there mkdir /path/to/code and cd/path/to/code On Windows you can make a folder in Windows Explorer andsince you have git installed right click and select Open Git Bash Here tolaunch a terminalNow you can clone your code:git clone https://githubcom/your-username/websitegitwhich will create a folder called website This is your git repository Inboth git bash or your Linux terminal cd websiteNow we need to add a reference to our upstream remote repository:git remote add upstream https://githubcom/wics-uw/websitegit Contributing content to the website  Creating a feature branch In git when we are working on a feature we usually split it off from themaster branch and refer to this branch as a feature branch or topic branchIf youre ready to work on a topic branch follow these easy steps Firstensure your master branch is up to date:git checkout master          Check out your master branchgit fetch upstream           Fetch any new upstream codegit rebase upstream/master   Rebase your master branch to match upstreamgit push origin master       Update your remote origin repositoryNow you can make a new topic branch off master:git checkout -b topic-name   Equivalent to git branch topic-name then checkout Commit structure Here are some tips for structuring your commits These are generally consideredbest practices Use present-tense imperative commit messages   DONT write This fixes issue 234 by optimizing the algorithm   DO write Optimizes algorithm fixes 234 Write descriptive commit messages that give the reviewer the big picture   DONT write Updates in css files this is redundant and can be    determined by viewing the files the patch modifies   DO feel free to write multi-line commit messages keep in mind that    while only the first line is visible in summary view additional comments    below go into the git log and can be very useful Separate commits in the smallest logical reversible steps possible   DONT submit multiple small commits fixing typos rebase these into a    single commit   DO include whitespace updates in a separate commit from code changes    template changes separate from adding content etc Ask for help if youre not sure how to do some of these thingsRemember: code reviews will help catch these things and give you a better ideaof whats considered standard Dont fear constructive feedback Seeing what your change looks like Before submitting a pull request you can test your change locally to see whatit will look like on the website If you dont want to testlocallytesting-locally or are having trouble setting it up you can alsojust submit a pull request and wait for someone to deploy a Heroku ReviewAppheroku-review-apps Submitting pull requests After youve made your modifications on your topic branch perhaps followingthe guide in the Development section you can now ask for your code to bemerged by submitting a pull requestTo do so first push your code to your personal remote origin:git push origin topic-nameThen log onto GitHub Youll find a big green button asking if you want tosubmit a pull request Click it and follow the steps to submit your pullrequestOnce its merged you can click the Delete branch button on GitHub In yourlocal repository the branch can be deleted with thegit branch -d topic-namecommand Reviewing a pull request There are three views for reviewing a pull request on GitHub: ConversationCommits and Files changedConversation- Comments on the pull request show up here including any inline comments that  are added when viewing the file diffs A summary of submitted commits is also  listed- Use this section to submit general feedback about the pull requestCommits- A more detailed list of commits included in the pull request that will allow  a reviewer to view each individually- Usually before merging youll want all the commits from that change to be  squashed into a single commit Some of the reasons for this is so that the  commit can show the whole change that was made and so that there arent a  bunch of typo fixes in the repositorys commit historyFiles changed- The diff view of the pull request Lets the reviewer see the full patch in  its entirety and add inline comments on changes- Use this section to submit line-specific feedback Giving feedback Everyone is invited to give feedback regardless of experience Comments cantouch on:- phrasing of any text added typos awkward phrasing using gendered language  where it could be gender neutral- tags on event posts do they make sense are they existing tags- lines that are over 80 characters long which we avoid except for certain  cases like the metadata at the top of many of the files- any identation thats hard to read - the way the change looks on the Heroku Review Appheroku-review-apps- if there are multiple commmits that can be squashed into one  commitsquashing-commits- linking to the site with a static urls instead of relative   urlshttps://githubcom/wics-uw/website/issues/222 which generally is bad  practicehttp://stackoverflowcom/questions/2005079/You can even look at it and decide it looks good and just comment with looksgood to me  Squashing commits If you have x commits you want to squash into one rungit rebase -i HEADx- youll see a list of the last x commits- keep the first one as pick- choose fixup or you can just type f for the rest of the commits- save and close and there should just be one commit there to confirm you  can run git logWhen you push the new squashed commit git will be confused and think youremissing those x commits when really you just turned them all into a newsingle commit You might see the error message failed to push some refs tohttps://githubcom/some-path and a suggestion to run git pull Do notever run git pull It will bring back in a copy of all the commits yousquashed and potentially other commits unrelated to your change Instead rungit push --force Pulling in changes Maybe while you were working on your change someone else contributed updatesto the repository and you want add them to your branch Do not ever run gitpull Instead run:git fetch upstreamgit rebase upstream/mastergit push -f origin HEADIf you cant fetch from upstream you might have to add a reference to ourupstream remote repo:git remote add upstream https://githubcom/wics-uw/websitegit Merging A back-and-forth revision process will occur during the course of the reviewFor the developer to update the pull request they simply need to push newchanges to the topic branch being considered sometimes using a force-push ifthey need to rewrite commitsWhen all parties are happy with the patch the reviewer can then sign off andmerge the code by clicking the big green Merge button This code is thenmerged into the upstream master branch For the changes to appear on thewebsite someone needs to deploy the new code see the Deployment sectionfor more details Development You can either add content to the site or modify its theme Adding site content All site content is contained in the content/ directory Posts are sorted byterm directories eg F2014 There is also a pages/ directory thatcontains non-post type pages such as contact info about us etc Posts We currently use three posting categories: Blog Events and Media Use the Media category for video recordings of talks and events Use the Events category to advertise event details Use the Blog category for everything else: news essays etcYou can also tag posts Try to use tags that have already been used on theother posts but feel free to add new tags as necessaryPlease try to use a consistent naming scheme Articles are named by termcategory and slug for instance posting a video of a talk about automata inS13 might be named S13-media-automatamd Pages We only need a limited number of pages You probably wont need to add manymore These include things like our Code of Conduct contact info etcIt might be useful to add a page that doesnt show up in the site navigationTo do so make sure you set Status: hidden in the Markdown preamble Thiswill cause the page to be generated without showing up in the sites mainnavigation Markup beautification The theme we are currently using is called notmyidea Pelican uses thejinja2http://jinjapocooorg/docs/dev/ templating system if youve usedDjango youll find the templates very similarTo modify the theme css or html simply take a look at the theme data undertheme/notmyidea/ and modify it at will Testing Locally To test a local copy of the site youll need to start the development serverTheres no additional software you need to install to launch a local version ofthe site Simply run/developserversh startin the top directory which will launch the development server on port 8000Then you can navigate to the local site by visiting http://localhost:8000 inyour browser This script will conveniently regenerate the site every time youmake a change to a file so you wont need to rerun this commandTo shut down the development server use/developserver stop Heroku Review Apps When prompted Heroku will provision temporary public web hosting and a domainname for any open pull request and post a pingback on GitHub This allowsanyone to access the temporary site and review what our website would looklike upon merging the changes from that pull request Permissions to access HerokuAccess to Heroku is granted to all committers in the wics-uw GitHuborganization Membership to the committers group is granted to all fullSystems Committee members as well as individuals that the Systems Committeehave chosen in recognition of their contributions and demonstratedresponsibility and good judgmentTo become a committer youll need to learn git contribute regularly to theWiCS website both opening pull requests and reviewing them and then ask theSystems Committee for access by emailing wics-syslistsuwaterlooca To deploy a pull request1 Go to https://dashboardherokucom/appshttps://dashboardherokucom/apps2 Click on wics-site3 In the left column named Review Apps find the PR you want to deploy and   click the button that says Create Review App Deployment We are currently using the Computer ScienceClubhttps://csclubuwaterloocas
