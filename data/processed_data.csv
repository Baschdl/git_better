Rancher Labs DocumentationThis README file includes information pertaining to the documentation project for both Rancher and Rancher OS RancherRancher is an open source project that provides a complete platform for operating Docker in production It provides infrastructure services such as multi-host networking global and local load balancing and volume snapshots It integrates native Docker management capabilities such as Docker Machine and Docker Swarm It offers a rich user experience that enables devops admins to operate Docker in production at large scale Rancher OSOperating system composed entirely of Docker containers Everything in RancherOS is a container managed by Docker This includes system services such as udev and syslog RancherOS includes only the bare minimum amount of software needed to run Docker Rancher Labs Documentation websiteRancher documentation is available at http://docsranchercom/rancher/As Rancher has gone GA weve added in version control The default Rancher docs site will always be referring to the latest release We will branch off specific versions of Rancher that are deemed GA which would also be tagged as rancher/server:stableCurrently weve added support for Chinese version of the docs site per community request Currently Rancher will not be actively translating the docs site but we welcome PRsRancher OS documentation is available at http://docsranchercom/os/ Contributing to Rancher Labs Documentation Project About Rancher Labs Documentation SiteRancher Labs documentation is hosted on GitHub Pages and published online by using Jekyll an easy blog-aware static website generator For more details on how to set up Jekyll we recommend you to read https://helpgithubcom/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/ If you are using Windows we strongly advise you to follow the instruction given at http://jekyllrbcom/docs/windows/For information on editing md files Markdown refer to https://daringfireballnet/projects/markdown/syntax Setting up the Git EnvironmentIn your browser navigate to https://githubcom/rancher/ranchergithubioFork this repository by clicking the Fork button on the upper right-hand side A fork of the repository is generated for you On the right-hand side of the page of your fork under HTTPS clone URL copy the URL by clicking the Copy to clipboard iconOn your computer follow these steps to setup a local repository to start working on the documentation:shellgit clone https://githubcom/YOURACCOUNT/ranchergithubiogitcd ranchergithubiogit remote add upstream https://githubcom/rancher/ranchergithubiogit checkout mastergit fetch upstreamgit merge upstream/master Updating the FilesWe recommend you to create a new branch to update the documentation files and that you do not disturb the master branch other than pulling in changes from upstream/masterFor example you create a branch dev on your computer to make changes locally to the documentation This dev branch will be your local repository which then be pushed to your forked repository on GitHub where you will create a Pull Request for the changes to be committed into the official documentationIt is a healthy practice to create a new branch each time you want to contribute to the documentation and only track the changes for that pull request in this branchshellgit checkout -b devThe argument -b dev creates a new branch named dev Now you can make necessary changes to the documentationshellgit add git commit -a -m commit message for your changesYou can optionally run Jekyll locally on your computer to be able to see the final result of your modifications and you write them For that use the command below You can refer to Jekylls official websitehttps://jekyllrbcom/ for more detailsshelljekyll serve Merging upstream/master into Your Local Branch devMaintain an up-to-date master branch in your local repository Merge the changes on a daily basis from the upstream/master the official documentation repository into your local repositoryEnsure that you do complete this activity before you start working on a feature as well as right before you submit your changes as a pull requestYou can also do this process periodically while you work on your changes to make sure that you are working off the most recent version of the documentationshell Checkout your local master branchgit checkout master Synchronize your local repository with upstream/master so that you have all the latest changesgit fetch upstream Merge the latest changes from the upstream/master into your local master branch to make it up-to-dategit merge upstream/master Checkout your local development branch eg: devgit checkout dev Pull the latest changes into your local development branchgit pull master Making a Pull Request on GitHubImportant: Ensure that you have merged upstream/master into your dev branch before you do the followingAfter you have made necessary changes to the documentation and are ready to contribute them create a Pull Request on GitHub You do it by pushing your changes to your forked repository usually called origin and then initiating a pull requestgit push origin mastergit push origin devNow follow the steps below to initiate a Pull request on GitHub1  Navigate your browser to your forked repository: https://githubcom/YOURACCOUNT/ranchergithubiogit1  Click the Compare  pull request button on the upper side of the forked repository1  Enter a clear description for the changes you have made1  Click Send Pull RequestIf you are asked to make modifications to your proposed changes make the changes locally on your dev branch and push the changes The Pull Request will be automatically updated Cleaning up the Local RepositoryYou no longer need the dev branch after the changes have been committed into upstream/master If you want to make additional documentation changes restart the process with a new branchgit checkout mastergit branch -D devgit push origin

text links and creating imagesTo add an image:- click on the add image button- click selecting one- pick a file on your local computer- in the image url field ensure to change the url from something likeposts/blog/yourimagenamejpgtoimages/blog/yourimagenamejpgthis is changing the path of the image to be images/blog/ rather then posts/blogthis is important as the image will not work if this is not done- add in alt text for the image alt text is important for users that browse by websites using text readers Adding a NotificationTo add a new notification:0 Open up

own changes you will need Jekyll installed click here for Jekyll installation instructionshttp://jekyllrbcom/docs/installation/Fork and clone the repository then install dependencies requires ruby and bundler shcd sfbrigadegithubio//scripts/setupFinally run the following command in the root directory of the repo:     bundle exec jekyll serveor     bundle exec jekyll serve --watchThe latter will cause Jekyll to watch for file changes and automaticallyregenerate the HTML though you will still need to refresh the browserIf the --watch flag does not work try the following instead:     bundle

patterns and learning resources SetupThis site is made with DocPadhttps://githubcom/bevry/docpad a static generator in Nodehttp://nodejsorg/ and the best way to install it is via npmhttp://npmjsorg/First you need to clone the project:sh git clone https://githubcom/webcomponents/webcomponentsgithubioThen go to the folder and install all dependencies:sh cd webcomponentsgithubio npm installNow youre good to go UsageDocPad has three basic options used in this project:To regenerate the site as you edit and save files which can be viewed at http://localhost:9778 run:sh npm run watchTo generate a static version of the site that is ready to upload to a server it will create a folder called out run:sh npm run buildTo generate and send the output to gh-pages branch run:sh npm run deploy TasksWe use Grunthttp://gruntjscom/ a task-runner in Nodehttp://nodejsorg/ to automate thingsTo install it and all the other dependencies run:sh npm install -g grunt-cliTo check performance regressions run:sh grunt pagespeed PS: Youll need to generate a PageSpeed API keyhttps://developersgooglecom/speed/docs/insights/v1/gettingstartedauth and defined it as an environment variable Browser

EnvironmentIf you have jekyll installed simply run jekyll serve in Command Lineand preview the themes in your browser You can use jekyll serve --watch to watch for changes in the source files as well Get StartedYou can easily get started by modifying configyml: Site settingstitle: Hux Blog              title of your websiteSEOTitle: Hux Blog check out docs for more detaildescription: Cool Blog      SNS settings      githubusername: huxpro      modify this account to yoursweibousername: huxpro       the footer woule be auto-updated Build settings paginate: 10               nums of posts in one pageThere are more options you can check out in the Jekyll - Official Sitehttp://jekyllrbcom/ or you can directly dive into code to find more Write PostsFeel free to checkout Markdown files in the posts/ you will quickly realized how to post your articles with magical markdown plus this nice themeThe front-matter of a post looks like that:---layout:     posttitle:      Hello 2015subtitle:   Hello World Hello Blogdate:       2015-01-29 12:00:00author:     Huxheader-img: img/post-bg-2015jpgtags:    - Life--- SideBarhttp://huangxuanme/img/blog-sidebarjpgSeeing more information may be necessary for you to display from V11 a clean gorgeous SideBar is added for you which provide more area for displaying possible modules You can enable it is default enable this feature by simply config: Sidebar settingssidebar: truesidebar-about-description: your description heresidebar-avatar: /img/avatar-huxjpg      use absolute URLWe default support Featured Tagsfeatured-tags Mini About Memini-about-me and Friendsfriends these three modules and you can add your own The sidebar is naturally responsive and would be push to bottom in a small screen size  992px according to Bootstarp Grid Systemhttp://getbootstrapcom/css/grid  More details of these three separate modules are talking below Mini About MeMini-About-Me module display all your SNS buttons also your avatar and the description if you set sidebar-avatar and sidebar-about-description which is very useful and common for a sidebar so it is default with your sidebarIt is really nice-looking and well-designed It would be hidden in a small screen seeing the sidebar would be push to bottom and there is already a footer including SNS feature which is similar Featured TagsConsidering the Featured-Tags feature in Mediumhttp://mediumcom is pretty cool so I add it in my blog theme also   This module is independent of sidebar from V14 so it can definitely live without enable sidebar which would be displayed in the bottom when sidebar set to false and it is not only displayed in home page but also every post page bottom Featured Tagsfeatured-tags: true  featured-condition-size: 1      A tag will be featured if the size of it is more than this condition valueThe only one thing need to be paid attention to is the featured-condition-size: A tag will be featured if the size of it is more than this condition value  Internally a condition template  if tag1size  sitefeatured-condition-size  is used to do the filter FriendsFriends is a very common feature of a blog seeing the SEO so I add it in V11 release to help that   Friends can also live without enable sidebar also be displayed in the bottom when sidebar unable and be displayed in every post page bottomYou can just add your friends information in configyml with a familiar JSON syntax and everything is done very easy: Friendsfriends:             title: Foo Blog        href: http://foogithubio/                title: Bar Blog        href: http://bargithubio     Keynote Layouthttp://huangxuanme/img/blog-keynotejpgThere is a increasing tendency to use Open Web technology to create keynotes presentations like Revealjs Impressjs Slides Prezi etc I consider a modern blog should have abilities to post these HTML based presentation easily also abilities to play it directlyUnder the hood a iframe is used to include webpage from outer source so the only things left is to give a url in the front-matter:---layout:     keynoteiframe:     http://huangxuanme/js-module-7day/---The iframe will be automatically resized to adapt different form factors also the device orientation A padding is left to imply user that there has more content below also to ensure that there is a area for user to scroll down in mobile device seeing most of the keynote framework prevent the browser default scroll behavior CommentThis theme support both Disqushttp://disquscom and Duoshuohttp://duoshuocom as the third party discussion systemFirst you need to sign up and get your own account Repeat DO NOT use mine I have set Trusted Domains It is deathly simple to sign up and you will get the full power of management system Please give it a trySecond from V15 you can easily complete your comment configuration by just adding your short name into configyml:duoshuousername: yourduoshuoshortname ORdisqususername: yourdisqusshortnameTo the old version user its better that you pull the new version otherwise you have to replace code in posthtml keynotehtml and abouthtml by yourselvesFurthermore Duoshuo support Sharing if you only wanna use Duoshuo comment without sharing you can set duoshuoshare: false You can use Duoshuo Sharing and Disqus Comments together also AnalyticsFrom V15 we support Google Analytics and Baidu Tongji officially with a deathly simple config: Baidu Analyticsbatrackid: 4cc1f2d8f3067386cc5cdb626a202900 Google Analyticsgatrackid: UA-49627206-1             Format: UA-xxxxxx-xxgadomain: huangxuanmeJust checkout the code offered by Google/Baidu and copy paste here all the rest is already done for youGoogle might ask for meta tag google-site-verification CustomizationIf you wanna do more customization and change code yourself a Gruntgruntjscom environment is also included Thanks to Clean BlogThere are a number of tasks it performs like minification of the JavaScript compiling of the LESS files adding banners to keep the Apache 20 license intact and watching for changes Run the grunt default task by entering grunt  into your command line which will build the files You can use grunt watch if you are working on the JavaScript or the LESSTry to understand code in include/ and layouts/ then you can modify Jekyll Liquidhttps://githubcom/Shopify/liquid/wiki template directly to do more creative customization Header ImageChange header images of any pages or any posts is pretty easy as mentioned above But thanks to issue 6 in Chinesehttps://githubcom/Huxpro/huxprogithubio/issues/6 asked how to make it looks greatWellit is actually a design issue not a coding stuff It is better that you have basic design knowledge but not is ok let me told you how to make it well-designed:Seeing the title text above image is white the image should be dark to emphasize the contract so we can easily add a black overlay with fews of opacity which is depends on the brightness of the original images you used you can process it in Photoshop Sketch etcIn technical views it can be done with CSS However the opacity of the black overlay is really hard to assigned every image has different brightness so the  degree it should be adjusted is different so it is impossible to hard code it SEO TitleBefore V14 site setting title is not only used for displayed in Home Page and Navbar but also used to generate the title in HTMLIts possible that you want the two things different For me my site-title is Hux Blog but I want the title shows in search engine is   Hux Blog which is multi-languageSo the SEO Title is introduced to solve this problem you can set SEOTitle different from title and it would be only used to generate HTML title and setting DuoShuo Sharing Page Build WarningThere are many possible reasons to cause a Page Build Warning email or similar errorOne of these is that github changes its build environment You are attempting to use the pygments highlighter which is currently unsupported on GitHub Pages Your site will use rouge for highlighting instead To suppress this warning change the highlighter value to rouge in your configymlSo just edit configyml find highlighter: pygments change it to highlighter: rouge and the warning will be goneFor other circumstances check out existing issues or create a new one LicenseApache License 20Copyright c 2015-2016 HuxproHux Blog is derived from Clean

the documentation and/or website for KubernetesYou can click the Fork button in the upper-right area of the screen to create a copy of our site on your GitHub account called a fork Make any changes you want in your fork and when you are ready to send those changes to us go to the index page for your fork and click New Pull Request to let us know about itFor more information about contributing to the Kubernetes documentation see: Creating a Documentation Pull Requesthttp://kubernetesio/docs/contribute/create-pull-request/ Writing a New Topichttp://kubernetesio/docs/contribute/write-new-topic/ Staging Your Documentation Changeshttp://kubernetesio/docs/contribute/stage-documentation-changes/ Using Page Templateshttp://kubernetesio/docs/contribute/page-templates/ Automatic Staging for Pull RequestsWhen you create a pull request either against master or the upcoming release your changes are staged in a custom subdomain on Netlify so that you can see your changes in rendered form before the PR is merged You can use this to verify that everything is correct before the PR gets merged To view your changes:- Scroll down to the PRs list of Automated Checks- Click Show All Checks- Look for deploy/netlify youll see Deploy Preview Ready if staging was successful- Click Details to bring up the staged site and navigate to your changes Branch structure and stagingThe current version of the website is served out of the master branch To make changes to the live docs such as bug fixes broken links typos etc target your pull request to the master branchThe release-1x branch stores changes for upcoming releases of Kubernetes For example the release-15 branch has changes for the 15 release These changes target branches and not master to avoid publishing documentation updates prior to the release for which theyre relevant If you have a change for an upcoming release of Kubernetes target your pull request to the appropriate release branchThe staging site for the next upcoming Kubernetes release is here: http://kubernetes-io-vnext-stagingnetlifycom/http://kubernetes-io-vnext-stagingnetlifycom/ The staging site reflects the current state of whats been merged in the release branch or in other words what the docs will look like for the next upcoming release Its automatically updated as new PRs get merged Staging the site locally using DockerDont like installing stuff Download and run a local staging server with a single docker run command    git clone https://githubcom/kubernetes/kubernetesgithubiogit    cd kubernetesgithubio    docker run -ti --rm -v PWD:/k8sdocs -p 4000:4000 gcrio/google-samples/k8sdocs:10Then visit http://localhost:4000http://localhost:4000 to see our site Any changes you make on your local machine will be automatically stagedIf youre interested you can view the Dockerfile for this imagehttps://githubcom/kubernetes/kubernetesgithubio/blob/master/staging-container/Dockerfile Staging the site locally from scratch setupThe below commands to setup your environment for running GitHub pages locally Then any edits you make will be viewableon a lightweight webserver that runs on your local machineThis will typically be the fastest way by far to iterate on docs changes and see them staged once you get this set up but it does involve several install steps that take awhile to complete and makes system-wide modificationsInstall Ruby 22 or higher If youre on Linux run these commands:    apt-get install software-properties-common    apt-add-repository ppa:brightbox/ruby-ng    apt-get install ruby22    apt-get install ruby22-dev If youre on a Mac follow these instructionshttps://gorailscom/setup/osx/ If youre on a Windows machine you can use the Ruby Installerhttp://rubyinstallerorg/downloads/ During the installation make sure to check the option for Add Ruby executables to your PATHThe remainder of the steps should work the same across operating systemsTo confirm youve installed Ruby correctly at the command prompt run gem --version and you should get a response with your version number Likewise you can confirm you have Git installed properly by running git --version which will respond with your version of GitInstall the GitHub Pages package which includes Jekyll:gem install github-pagesClone our site:git clone https://githubcom/kubernetes/kubernetesgithubiogitMake any changes you want Then to see your changes locally:cd kubernetesgithubiojekyll serveYour copy of the site will then be viewable at: http://localhost:4000http://localhost:4000or wherever Jekyll tells you GitHub helpIf youre a bit rusty with git/GitHub you might want to readthishttp://readwritecom/2013/10/02/github-for-beginners-part-2 for a refresher Common Tasks Edit Page Titles or Change the Left NavigationEdit the yaml files in /data/ for the Guides Reference Samples or Support areasYou may have to exit and jekyll clean before restarting the jekyll serve toget changes to files in /data/ to show up Add ImagesPut the new image in /images/docs/ if its for the documentation and just /images/ if its for the websiteFor diagrams we greatly prefer SVG files Include code from another fileTo include a file that is hosted on this GitHub repo insert this code:pre123 include codehtml languageltLEXERVALUEgt fileltRELATIVEPATHgt ghlinkltPATHFROMROOTgt 125/pre LEXERVALUE: The language in which the file was written must be a value supported by

relative to root eg /docs/admin/fooyamlTo include a file that is hosted in the external main Kubernetes repo make sure its added to /update-imported-docsshhttps://githubcom/kubernetes/kubernetesgithubio/blob/master/update-imported-docssh and run it so that the file gets downloaded then enter:pre123 include codehtml

the docs eg release-12 pageversion The version of Kubernetes associated with this branch of the docs eg v12 pagedocsbranch The name of the GitHub branch on the Docs/Website repo that you are currently using eg release-11 or masterThis keeps the docs youre editing aligned with the Kubernetes version youre talking about For example if you define a link like so youll never have to worry about it going stale in future doc branches:preView the README herehttp://releasesk8sio/123123pagegithubbranch125125/cluster/addons/READMEmd/preThat of course will send users

PartnersKubernetes partners refers to the companies who contribute to the Kubernetes core codebase and/or extend their platform to support Kubernetes Partners can get their logos added to the partner section of the community pagehttp://k8sio/community by following the below steps and meeting the below logo specifications Partners will also need to have a URL that is specific to integrating with Kubernetes ready this URL will be the destination when the logo is clicked The partner product logo should be a transparent png image centered in a 215x125 px frame look at the existing logos for reference The logo must link to a URL that is specific to integrating with Kubernetes hosted on the partners site The logo should be named product-namelogopng and placed in the /images/communitylogos folder The image reference including the link to the partner URL should be added in communityhtml under div classpartner-logos  /div Please do not change the order of the existing partner images Append your logo to the end of the list Once completed and tested the look and feel submit the pull request Thank youKubernetes thrives on community participation and we really appreciate

customize each ontology pageNote that each md file is the primary source for the metadata for eachontology It may seem odd to mix the markdown in with the yaml but inpractice this works well and is easy to mainpulate using the pythonscript in the util/ directoryThe one piece of visual info in the md is the layout field which is necessary for Jekyll Generation of downstream artefactsOBO admins should periodically    git pull    make    jekyll server     open 127001:4000 in a web browser and spot-check changes    git commit -m regenerated derived files -a    git push origin masterSee the Makefile for details This will have the effect ofregenerating the main ontologies yaml used by external consumers suchas OLS as well as the central OBO library build as well as theGitHub pages configyml file This last step is necessary to updatethe front page RDFThe yaml is all YAML-LD and can compile down to RDF/OWL using a generic translator eg JENA plus our context file Community ContributionsNote that general OBO users are free to edit via the github webinterface and make a pull request They can update their own entriesbut they are also welcome to suggest changes elsewhereOn the live site each page has links to view source and edit source This makes use of githubs builtin editing facilityFor example:  view ontology/uberonmdhttps://githubcom/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundrygithubio/blob/master/ontology/uberonmd   edit ontology/uberonmdhttps://githubcom/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundrygithubio/edit/master/ontology/uberonmd Note that joe randoms cannot just come in and update things Anyone with a github ID can make pull requesthttps://helpgithubcom/articles/using-pull-requests/aka PR It is up to the OBO team whether the PR may be merged or rejectedNote that if you make a syntax error whilst editing then the travischeck will fail Your PR will have a big red X next to it in whichcase the OBO team will not merge your PR Dont worry all you have todo is make further edits to fix the syntax errorTODO: add a quick guide to yaml and the tags we use Central OBO library buildsee also the FAQ entry on thisThe central OBO build runs here:  http://buildberkeleyboporg/job/simple-build-obo-all/It takes as metadata input the yml file from this repository It makesuse of the build objectThe output of this job is a set of obo and owl files deposited in  http://berkeleyboporg/ontologies/Depending on the build configuration this may also make additional files See for example:  http://berkeleyboporg/ontologies/uberon/A  http://berkeleyboporg/ontologies/ URL should never be handed out directly This service exists so that:  Un PURL-registered ontologies will have a fall-through  Registered PURL ontologies that do not want to take charge of either OBO or OWL generation will have a place to 302-redirect toThis job will fail if ontologies marked as infallible fail To debug the full log of the last build can be examined:  https://buildberkeleyboporg/job/simple-build-obo-all/lastBuild/consoleFullLook for the text should not fail Adding newsSimply add a post to the posts/posts/ directory -

Jekyllhttp://jekyllrbcom/ site deployed on GitHubpageshttps://pagesgithubcom/All API documentation submissions are welcome To submit a change fork this repo commit your changes and send us apull requesthttp://helpgithubcom/send-pull-requests/ Setup EnvironmentMost of the content of the developer site is written in a format calledkramdownhttp://kramdowngettalongorg/syntaxhtml which is a flavor of Markdown with some enhanced features like theability to do footnote notations We use Kramdown because the markup is both human readable and convertable in to fullyfledged HTML If theres some functionality you cant implement in Kramdown you can always drop down into HTML as alast resortThough kramdown gives us benefits of readbilty it comes at the cost of requiring a build step to preview the changes tothe site Jekyll handles this nicely by detecting changes to the file system and refreshing automatically To setupJekyll to be able to build and view the site follow the steps below: 1 Install RVM if you dont already have it On OSX brew install rvm or on linux yum install rvm To ensure you have   rvm installed properly run rvm list and ensure that there is a version marked as current2 Clone repository git clone gitgithubcom:okta/oktagithubiogit3 Go into project directory cd oktagithubio4 You maybe told that the version of ruby needed by this project isnt installed follow the given instruction to   install the correct verion of ruby for RVM If you did have to install a new version of ruby re-enter the directory   youre in cd cd oktagithubio then verify that the current gemset youre using is called oktagithubio by   running rvm gemset list This project sepcifies a gemset so that the build of this project isnt affected by global   gems on your system5 Now install gems needed by this project into the projects gemset with gem install bundler and then bundle install   This will essentially read the Gemfile in the root directory and install all packages required to run the site6 Start the site bundle exec jekyll serve --watch8 Visit http://localhost:4000 in your browser9 To stop serving the site hit ctrlc in the terminal Publishing Changes the build processThough github pages do support an automatic build process we use a custom toolbar gem which requires that we build thesite ourselves This means that this git repo contains both the source files of the site and the compiled site files Aswe edit the site we should only make changes to the source files and then rely on the following build process to compileand generate the final site content Important Directories source this is where the source files live If youre editing content or adding assets like images or css they  belong in here docs The output HTML files live in this directory Dont edit this content itll be overwritten with every build site this directory is ignored in github It contains the local version of each of the built files in the site almost everything else most of the other directories in the root are the checked in versions of the built site  These files should not be edited directly Find the corresponding version of the file in the source directory modify  that and then re-run the build Build Steps1 Create a topic branch or your work git checkout -b branchname2 Make changes / additions in source directory3 Compile changes into the site directory bundle exec jekyll serve --watch4 Navigate the site and validate your changes5 Stop Jekyll with ctrlc6 Sync the built site files with the checked-in code with: rsync -av site/ /7 Git commit and push changes to github When ready for review create a pull request and mention the users you want to   review your changes Resolving conflicts with upstreamIf you are making changes in a fork here is how to make a clean Pull Request against upstream:1 sync your forkhttps://helpgithubcom/articles/fork-a-repo/keep-your-fork-synced to https://githubcom/okta/oktagithubio/   The command git remote add upstream gitgithubcom:okta/oktagithubiogit is the key part of this step2 After running git fetch upstream in the guide above run this command to pull down changes from upstream:   git merge -s recursive -X theirs upstream/master Contribution ProcessOkta uses theGitHub Flowhttps://guidesgithubcom/introduction/flow/workflow for contributionsPlease read the linkedGitHub Flowhttps://guidesgithubcom/introduction/flow/document to learn the details of that workflowHere is a high-level overview of the GitHub flow:1  Optional Fork this repository2  Create a branch using the git checkout -b BRANCHNAME command    Replace BRANCHNAME with your branch name3  Add commits to your branch using the git add and git commit -m  commands    Push your commits to your branch with the git push command for    example: git push origin BRANCHNAME4  Open a Pull Request    using the GitHub UIhttps://helpgithubcom/articles/using-pull-requests/5  Discuss and review your code using the GitHub UI6  Once your Pull Request has been reviewed and approved one of the    project owners for this site will merge and deploy your Pull    Request Details for the Add commits step1 Clone repository using git clone - the files are organized in this repository as follows:     The root folder / contains the files served by GitHub     source folder contains the source files     site is still ignored2 Create a branch for your changes using git checkout -b BRANCHNAME to create a branch for your changes3 Make changes under the source directory4 Serve the site locally using the jekyll serve -w command5 Preview using http://locahost:4000 Details for the merge and deploy stepDo the following after accepting a pull request:1 Pull down the latest changes using git pull origin master to pull down the latest changes2 Compile the site locally using the jekyll build command3 rsync files from the site directory to repository root directory / with the rsync -r site/ / command4 Add the updated files using the git add  command5 Commit the updated files using the git commit -m your message here command6 Push to GitHub using git push origin master to push to GitHub Note that GitHub will not compile the site Authoring Guide PagesPages are single purpose html or markdown files1 Create a folder with indexhtml file eg pricing/indexhtml2 Author front matter as follows: ---layout: pagetitle: YOURTITLEcss: CSSFILENAMEcss optional page specific css file---3 Put html or css content under front matter4 Expose link to page in header or elsewhere URL will be the folder   name indexhtml is not necessary eg /pricing Docs1  Create PAGENAMEmd in docs/FOLDERNAME eg docs/api/rest/usersmd2  Filenames are underscore seperated and all lowercase eg mycooldocpagemd3  Author front matter ---layout: docspagetitle: Title Case Name of Page---4  The content under the front matter should not have any h1s -    this will be set by the title property5  All h2s in the content will be rendered as a link in the table    of contents6  Create placement entry in manifest at data/docsyml in    appropriate pages section7  The pages name must match the filename without extension eg usersmd  users8  To create a new section in the manifest section: NAMEOFFOLDERtitle: TITLECASENAMEOFSECTION9  The sections structure should follow the folder names10 The ordering of sections and pages in the manifest determines the order in    which they appear in the leftnav Customers1  Create an indexmd folder in customers/CUSTOMERNAME eg customers/box/indexmd2  Create the images:indeximage:     220px x 165px 144dpi  // image used on index pageheaderimage:   1080px x 220px 144dpi  // title bar image on story pagediagramimage:   694px x npx 144dpi  // information graphic at bottom of story page3  Author front matter indexblurb will be clipped over three lines of textsidebarcopy will be markdownified Newlines sohuld be doubled Authors1  Create an entry in source/data/authorsyml2  Put avatar image in source/assets/img Make sure aspect ratio of image is square Blog Posts1 Create a file in source/posts/ with the form YYYY-mm-dd-the-titlemd2 The header should look something like:---layout: blogposttitle: Productionalizing ActiveMQauthor: oktagenericbloggertags: activemq jvm---3 Supporting images should be placed in source/assets/img and should follow the convetion:   nameofpost-image-nameextension where name of the post doesnt include the md extension This will allow us   to know which images are referenced by which post3 Look at other posts for

image:https://githubcom/arquillian/arquilliangithubcom/raw/develop/images/arquillianicon64pngIke Arquillian Website Source:toc::toc-title: Whats in here:toclevels: 2This repository contains the source of the Arquillian website hosted using http://pagesgithubcomgithub pages to which the http://arquillianorgarquillianorghostname resolvesThe website is built using http://awestructorgAwestruct The develop branch contains the unprocessed website source From that content Awestruct generates a static website under the site directory The website is published to the public site by pushing the contents of the site directory to the master branch Setting UpFirst and foremost clone this repository : In order to be able to generate the whole site you will also need to create a GitHub token for command-line use Follow this https://helpgithubcom/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/guide and put it in github-auth file in thre root of the cloned directory its already ignored by Git so you shouldnt be worried about compromising it Subsequent sections explain how to run Awesturct in Dockerized setup or Local setup Dockerized setupThe following instructions allow you to work on arquillianorg in the isolated Docker container while still being able to edit the content locally using your favorite editor If you dont have Docker installed please follow https://docsdockercom/engine/installation/this guide firstFirst step is to build the image based on Dockerfile included in the root folder of this repository Simply execute following commandsourceshelldocker build -t arquillian/blog This will create a Docker image tagged as arquillian/blogOnce you have the image built you can start Docker container to generate Awestruct stire from within it You can preview the site under http://localhost:4242 on Linux or http://docker-ip:4242 with boot2docker where docker-ip can be retrieved via boot2docker ipsourceshelldocker run -it --rm --nethost -v PWD:/home/dev/PWD/ -p 4242:4242 arquillian/blogThis command will work from the root of your arquillianorg directory as we mount the repository folder using -v PWD:/home/dev/PWD/--nethost flag might not be needed but in case when your website is not accessible from the host according to https://githubcom/docker/docker/issues/13914this issue in Docker GitHub repo this might be the solutionBefore you start Previewing the Site Locally there is one last command you need to execute from within running Docker container You have to install the gems required for the whole machinery to kick in From the root of your arquillianorg directory which is now accessible from within the container execute following command:sourceshell----bundle install -j 10  // 1----1 In addition you can add --path /gems or just use an alias install-gems to install gems inside the folder where your git repository is This will speed up subsequent runs of the containerAnd you are ready to start writingOr if you are brave enough continue reading next section to learn how to set it up locallyIMPORTANTIf you run the container on a SELinux-enabled host for example on Fedora you need to change the SELinux label ofthe directory that contains the source code of your website to be able to modify it from inside of the container:sourceshellchcon -t svirtsandboxfilet -R PWD Local setupYou need to have Awestruct installed on your machine to preview the website locally Awestruct is a available as Ruby gem in the GemCutter repository You can install it into either a native Ruby or a JRuby installation The instructions here will cover setting up Awestruct in both native Ruby and JRuby installation for Linux environmentBegin by installing the package for Ruby and RubyGems Installing Ruby and RubyGems on UbuntuIf you have Ubuntu use this command to install Ruby and RubyGems:sourceshell sudo apt-get install rubygemsUbuntu does not currently add the RubyGems bin directory to your path Put the following files in your shell configuration file bashrc and restart the shellsourceshell export GEMHOME/var/lib/gems/18 export PATHPATH:GEMHOME/binNow the executables for any gem you install will be available on your path Installing JRuby on UbuntuIt might happen that you will face https://gistgithubcom/1392032similar problem while trying to install awestruct using Ruby on Ubuntu In that case using JRuby as an alternative might solve itFirst download and unpack latest stable version of JRuby: The one available in Ubuntu repositories is too old and does not support Awestructsourceshell wget http://jrubyorgs3amazonawscom/downloads/167/jruby-bin-167targz tar -xzvf jruby-bin-167targzOptionally you can copy it to /usr/lib/jvm and create symbolic link for convenience:sourceshell sudo mv jruby-167/ /usr/lib/jvm cd /usr/lib/jvm/ sudo ln -s jruby-167/ jrubyLast step is adding JRuby to path for instance in bashrcsourceshell export JRUBYHOME/usr/lib/jvm/jruby export PATHJRUBYHOME/bin:PATHAlso make sure to unset GEMHOME for your session or else JRuby will try to install gems into your system installationsourceshell unset GEMHOMEThats it Just install all required gems described in subsequent sections and you are ready to run awestruct backed by JRubyNOTEUse jgem instead of sudo gem for this purpose Installing Ruby and RubyGems on FedoraIf you have Fedora use this command to install Ruby and RubyGems:sourceshell sudo yum install ruby ruby-devel ruby-irb rubygemsOptionally you can install RubyGems manually to use a newer version was once a requirement for installing Awestruct but has since been fixed:sourceshell wget -q http://productioncfrubygemsorg/rubygems/rubygems-1815tgz tar xzf rubygems-1815tgz cd rubygems-1815 sudo ruby setuprbIn Fedora RubyGems properly links applications such as awestruct to /usr/bin when the corresponding gem is installed so no need for messing with the PATH Installing the Awestruct GemNow you are ready to install awestruct The remainder of the commands work on any Ruby installation If youre using JRuby remember to use jgem instead of sudo gemUse this command to install the awestruct gem and its dependencies:sourceshell sudo gem install awestructIf you get a compiler error when RedCloth is installing use this command instead:sourceshell sudo gem install awestruct -- --with-cflags-O2 -pipe -marchnative -Wno-unused-but-set-variableYoure all setIf youve previously installed awestruct make sure you have Awestruct  0215 You can update it update it using this command:sourceshell sudo gem update awestructIMPORTANTIf youre using JRuby youll need to update your RedCloth gem to support international characters Follow these steps: Download https://githubcom/downloads/mojavelinux/redcloth/redclothscanjar Copy it to JRUBYHOME/lib/ruby/gems//gems/RedCloth-429-java/lib/ overwrite existing file Additional Required GemsAs the website matures more gems will be required This section documents the required third-party gems not already installed by AwestructInstall these Gems using the sudo gem install command or jgem install command for JRuby as you did above rest-client git vpim jruby-openssl if using jruby rb-inotify if using linux rical tzinfo hpricot RedCloth Installing Awestruct and Required Gems using BundlerNow theres an even easier way to get setuFirst make sure you have the Bundler gem installed:sourceshell sudo gem install bundlerNow Bundler can handle the rest of the setup automatically:sourceshell sudo bundle installAt this point you are ready to pull down the site and run it Previewing the Site LocallyNow that you have awestruct installed you can preview the website locally by running it in development mode Development mode uses a file monitor to automatically update the site when you make a change to the source filesTo run the site you first need the source code Begin by cloning the website source code from git:sourceshellgit clone git://githubcom/arquillian/arquilliangithubcomgitThen switch to the develop branch the master branch holds the published site only:sourceshellgit checkout developRun the following command to launch the preview server:sourceshellawestruct -dIMPORTANTCurrently when running awestruct in the preview mode some of the auto-generated pages eg modules are not generated If you want tosee them too please run full generation of site folder first as described belowVisit the following page in your browser:http://localhost:4242:http://localhost:4242Youre now awestructIf you only want to generate once when you start the server use this command:sourceshellawestruct --server -P developmentAdd the --force flag to either command to regenerate the site from scratch You can also remove the tmp and site directories to clean the generated files Conventionshttp://haml-langcomHaml is the preferred abstract HTML markup language

sidebar footerzwsp  intro content sectionprimary aside Writing a Blog EntryWriting a blog entry is very easy All you have to do is fill in a brief prolog at the top of the file then just type your content The rest is handled for you FilenameTo write a blog entry create a new textile document with the file extension textile in the blog/ folder The name of the file is important It determines the date of the blog entry and the URL The syntax is:YYYY-MM-DD-URLtextileYou cannot use dots or spaces in the URL segmentFor example:2011-10-02-announcing-arquillian-1-0textile PrologThe prolog is a set of name/value pairs defined at the top of the file in between two lines containing three dashes In this section you define the following metadata: layout always blog title use sentence capitalization author use github id tags array structure limit to 5 use singular forms as in releaseHeres an example refer to HTML output:source---layout: blogtitle: Ike is our heroauthor: aslakknutsentags:  announcements ike ---  only copy the hyphens and the lines of text between themIf you want the post to appear in the JBoss Central view in JBoss Tools add jbosscentral to the list of tags ContentBelow the prolog you just type in textile format CodeNOTE: Please follow the https://githubcom/jboss/ide-configreadmeJBoss Community syntax conventions when formatting the code to ensure all posts look consistentTo insert syntax highlighted code followed by paragraph text use the following syntax refer to HTML output of this guide:sourcejavapublic class Alien     public String getName         return Ike    This sentence will appear below the code The language is detected automaticallyYou dont normally need to use the prefix to enter a paragrah However its required after a code block to indicate to the parser that the code snippet has ended If the content following the code is not paragraph text for instance a list item use notextile instead of p but include one space at the end of the lineIf you are running awestruct in preview mode you need to touch the blog/indexhtmlhaml file to see the blog show up in the index likely a bug ImagesImages should be put in the images/blog/ folder An image should be no more than 600px wide Writing a Release NoteWriting a release note is even easier than blog post There is a template file created for this purpose blog/github-release-templatetextileSimply name your file using following convention repository-name-versionIdtextile eg arquillian-core-100CR6textile Fill in the most important features which are part of this particular releaseOther things like JIRA tasks are picked up automaticallyIf for some reason you are not able to see your release notes on blog/ aggregator page perform following steps:Delete where tag/release information is read from:source shellrm -rf tmp/repos/repo-that-contain-releaseDelete the overview from JIRA that contains all released versions:source shellrm -rf tmp/jira/jira-ARQjsonThen restart awestruct and everything should work nicely Writing a GuideWriting a guide is much like writing a blog entry and as such just as easy You need to supply some prolog information a header stating what the guide covers and content partitioned using level 3 h3 headings The rest is handled for you including the table of contents and listing in the indexIMPORTANTWhen committing a guide put it in a commit by itself and use a commit message that describes to a reader what changed Commit messages are used as the guides changelog FilenameTo write a blog entry create a new textile document with the file extension textile in the guides/ folder The name of the file will become the last path in the guides URL and thus should closely match the guides title Since its part of the URL the filename should not contain spaces PrologThe prolog is a set of name/value pairs defined at the top of the file in between two lines containing three dashes In this section you define the following metadata: layout always guide title use title capitalization authors comma seperated list of original authors of the guide translators comma seperated list for translations only tags comma seperated list guidesummary

URLserved at https://docsdockercom/Feel free to send us pull requests and file issues Our docs are completelyopen source and we deeply appreciate contributions from our community Providing feedbackWe really want your feedback and weve made it easy You can edit rate orfile an issue at the bottom of every page on docsdockercomPlease only file issues about the documentation in this repository One wayto think about this is that you should file a bug here if your issue is that youdont see something that should be in the docs or you see something incorrector confusing in the docs- If your problem is a general question about how to configure or use Docker  consider asking a question on https://forumsdockercom instead- If you have an idea for a new feature or behavior change in a specific aspect  of Docker or have found a bug in part of Docker please file that issue in  the projects code repository ContributingWe value your documentation contributions and we want to make it as easyas possible to work in this repository One of the first things to decide iswhich branch to base your work on If you get confused just ask and we willhelp If a reviewer realizes you have based your work on the wrong branch welllet you know so that you can rebase itNote: To contribute code to Docker projects see theContribution guidelinesopensource/project/who-written-for Overall doc improvementsMost commits will be made against the master branch This include:- Conceptual and task-based information not specific to new features- Restructuring / rewriting- Doc bug fixing- Typos and grammar errorsOne quirk of this project is that the master branch is where the live docs arepublished from so upcoming features cant be documented there SeeSpecific new features for a projectspecific-new-features-for-a-projectfor how to document upcoming features These feature branches will be periodicallymerged with master so dont worry about fixing typos and documentation bugsthereDo you enjoy creating graphics Good graphics are key to great documentationand we especially value contributions in this area Specific new features for a projectOur docs cover many projects which release at different times If and only ifyour pull request relates to a currently unreleased feature of a project baseyour work on that projects vnext branch These branches were created bycloning master and then importing a projects master branchs docs into itat the time of the migration in a way that preserved the commit history Whena project has a release its vnext branch will be merged into master and yourwork will be visible on docsdockercomThe following vnext branches currently exist:- vnext-enginehttps://githubcom/docker/dockergithubio/tree/vnext-engine:  docs for upcoming

https://githubcom/docker/dockergithubiogit    cd dockergithubio    docker-compose up        If you havent got Docker Compose installed    follow these installation instructions/compose/install/    The container runs in the background and incrementally rebuilds the site each    time a file changes You can keep your browser open to http://localhost:4000/    and refresh to see your changes The container runs in the foreground but    you can use CTRLC to get the command prompt back To stop the container    issue the following command:    bash    docker-compose down    2  Use Jekyll directly Clone this repo install Ruby 23 or higher    requiredhttps://wwwruby-langorg/en/documentation/installation/    install the GitHub Pages Ruby gemhttps://helpgithubcom/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/    then run jekyll serve from within the directory    The jekyll serve process runs in the foreground and starts a web server    running on http://localhost:4000/ by default To stop it use CTRLC    You can continue working in a second terminal and Jekyll will rebuild the    website incrementally Refresh the browser to preview your changes3  Use Github Pages with or without a local clone Fork this repo in GitHub    change your forks repository name to YOURGITHUBUSERNAMEgithubio and    make changes to the Markdown files in your master branch Browse to    https://YOURGITHUBUSERNAMEgithubio/ to preview the changes Important files- /data/tocyaml defines the left-hand navigation for the docs- /js/menujs defines most of the docs-specific JS such as TOC generation and menu syncing- /css/documentationcss defines the docs-specific style rules- /layouts/docshtml is the HTML template file which defines the header and footer and includes all the JS/CSS that serves the docs content Relative linking for GitHub viewingFeel free to link to /foomd so that the docs are readable in GitHub but keep in mind that Jekyll templating notation such as this  will render in raw text and not be processed In general its best to assume the docs are being readdirectly on docsdockercom Style guideIf you have questions about how to write for Dockers documentation please seethe style guide/opensource/doc-style/ The style guide providesguidance about grammar syntax formatting styling language or tone

Boot makes it easy to create Spring-powered production-grade applications andservices with absolute minimum fuss It takes an opinionated view of the Spring platformso that new and existing users can quickly get to the bits they needYou can use Spring Boot to create stand-alone Java applications that can be started usingjava -jar or more traditional WAR deployments We also provide a command line toolthat runs spring scriptsOur primary goals are: Provide a radically faster and widely accessible getting started experience for allSpring development Be opinionated out of the box but get out of the way quickly as requirements start todiverge from the defaults Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projectseg embedded servers security metrics health checks externalized configuration Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration Installation and Getting StartedThe docs/htmlsingle/reference documentation includes

Check the docs/htmlsingle/reference documentation especially the  docs/htmlsingle/howtoHow-tos -- they provide solutions to the most common  questions Learn the Spring basics -- Spring Boot builds on many other Spring projects check  the http://springiospringio web-site for a wealth of reference documentation If  you are just starting out with Spring try one of the http://springio/guidesguides Ask a question - we monitor http://stackoverflowcomstackoverflowcom for questions  tagged with http://stackoverflowcom/tags/spring-bootspring-boot Report bugs with Spring Boot at https://githubcom/spring-projects/spring-boot/issuesgithubcom/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues Reporting IssuesSpring Boot uses GitHubs integrated issue tracking system to record bugs and featurerequests If you want to raise an issue please follow the recommendations below: Before you log a bug please https://githubcom/spring-projects/spring-boot/searchtypeIssuessearch the issue tracker  to see if someone has already reported the problem If the issue doesnt already exist https://githubcom/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/newcreate a new issue Please provide as much information as possible with the issue report we like to know  the version of Spring Boot that you are using as well as your Operating System and  JVM version If you need to paste code or include a stack trace use Markdown  escapes  before and after your text If possible try to create a test-case or project that replicates the issue You can  submit sample projects as pull-requests against the  https://githubcom/spring-projects/spring-boot-issuesspring-boot-issues GitHub  project Use the issue number for the name of your project Building from SourceYou dont need to build from source to use Spring Boot binaries inhttp://repospringiorepospringio but if you want to try out the latest andgreatest Spring Boot can be easily built with thehttps://githubcom/takari/maven-wrappermaven wrapper You also need JDK 18 althoughBoot applications can run on Java 16indent0---- /mvnw clean install----If you want to build with the regular mvn command you will needhttp://mavenapacheorg/run-maven/indexhtmlMaven v321 or aboveNOTE: You may need to increase the amount of memory available to Maven by settinga MAVENOPTS environment variable with the value -Xmx512m Rememberto set the corresponding property in your IDE as well if you are building and runningtests there eg in Eclipse go to Preferences-Java-Installed JREs and edit theJRE definition so that all processes are launched with those arguments This propertyis automatically set if you use the maven wrapperAlso see link:CONTRIBUTINGadocCONTRIBUTINGadoc if you wish to submit pull requestsand in particular please fill out thehttps://supportspringsourcecom/springcommittersignupContributors Agreementbefore your first change however trivial Or if you filed such an agreement already foranother project just mention that in your pull request Building reference documentationThe reference documentation requires the documentation of the Maven plugin to beavailable so you need to build that first since its not generated by defaultindent0---- /mvnw clean install -pl spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-maven-plugin -Pdefaultfull----The documentation also includes auto-generated information about the starters Toallow this information to be collected the starter projects must be built first:indent0---- /mvnw clean install -f spring-boot-starters----Once this is done you can build the reference documentation with the command below:indent0---- /mvnw clean prepare-package -pl spring-boot-docs -Pdefaultfull----TIP: The generated documentation is available from spring-boot-docs/target/contents/reference ModulesThere are a number of modules in Spring Boot here is a quick overview: spring-bootThe main library providing features that support the other parts of Spring Bootthese include: The SpringApplication class providing static convenience methods that make it easyto write a stand-alone Spring Application Its sole job is to create and refresh anappropriate Spring ApplicationContext Embedded web applications with a choice of container Tomcat or Jetty for now First class externalized configuration support Convenience ApplicationContext initializers including support for sensible loggingdefaults spring-boot-autoconfigureSpring Boot can configure large parts of common applications based on the contentof their classpath A single EnableAutoConfiguration annotation triggersauto-configuration of the Spring contextAuto-configuration attempts to deduce which beans a user might need For example IfHSQLDB is on the classpath and the user has not configured any database connectionsthen they probably want an in-memory database to be defined Auto-configuration willalways back away as the user starts to define their own beans spring-boot-startersStarters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include inyour application You get a one-stop-shop for all the Spring and related technologythat you need without having to hunt through sample code and copy paste loads ofdependency descriptors For example if you want to get started using Spring and JPA fordatabase access just include the spring-boot-starter-data-jpa dependency in yourproject and you are good to go spring-boot-cliThe Spring command line application compiles and runs Groovy source making it supereasy to write the absolute minimum of code to get an application running Spring CLIcan also watch files automatically recompiling and restarting when they change spring-boot-actuatorSpring Boot Actuator provides additional auto-configuration to decorate your applicationwith features that make it instantly deployable and supportable in production  Forinstance if you are writing a JSON web service then it will provide a server securitylogging externalized configuration management endpoints an audit abstraction andmore If you want to switch off the built in features or extend or replace them itmakes that really easy as well spring-boot-loaderSpring Boot Loader provides the secret sauce that allows you to build a single jar filethat can be launched using java -jar Generally you will not need to usespring-boot-loader directly but instead work with thelink:spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-gradle-pluginGradle orlink:spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-maven-pluginMaven plugin SamplesGroovy samples for use with the command line application are available inlink:spring-boot-cli/samplesspring-boot-cli/samples To run the CLI samples typespring run samplegroovy from samples directoryJava samples are available in link:spring-boot-samplesspring-boot-samples and shouldbe built with maven and run by invoking java -jar target/samplejar GuidesThe http://springio/springio site contains several guides that show how to use SpringBoot step-by-step: http://springio/guides/gs/spring-boot/Building an Application with Spring Boot is a  very basic guide that shows you how to create a simple application run it and add some  management services http://springio/guides/gs/actuator-service/Building a RESTful Web Service with Spring  Boot Actuator is a guide to creating a REST web service and also shows how the server  can be configured http://springio/guides/gs/convert-jar-to-war/Converting a Spring Boot JAR Application  to a WAR shows you how to run applications in a web server as a WAR file

project contains four classes that aggregate most logic and a set of classes used to represent the nodes in the abstract syntax tree AST of a method The PPPTokenizerThe tokenizer implements the stream interface It operates on a string and returns instances of PPPToken The token types are identified via symbolic constants but have a number of test methods for a more finely grained check on their contents eg isOpeningCurlyBrace isIdentifier  Calling its next method repeatedly as defined by the Stream interface will yield new tokens until an EOF token is returned The PPPParserThe parser takes a stream of tokens so for us directly the PPPTokenizer and builds the AST based on those To facilitate the understanding of the parsing process and to give the methods a degree of isolation self nextToken always points at the first token of the node that is to be parsed upon entry of any parse method this contract is also the reason why self nextNextToken had to be created for assignmentsRough code flow when parsing a method is as follows: The method header is parsed parseMethod then either one of parseBinaryMessageDeclaration parseNamedMessageDeclaration parseUnaryMessageDeclaration The body of the method is parsed into a PPPSequenceNode parseSequence To parse the sequence parseStatement: is called repeatedly until the end of the method is reached parseStatement differentiates between assignments return statements and message sends message sends are further broken up into its three different types and special cases like cascades Any value blocks numbers literals  is regarded as receiver parseReceiver if its just an argument it will later not be wrapped in a PPPMessageNodeMethods responsible for parsing message sends carry a PPPParserState with them This is required for keeping the parse methods isolated while still maintaining the knowledge of whether we are currently parsing a multi part named message or a cascade The PPPPrinterThe printer is implemented as a visitor over the AST Each visit method returns a string so that the resulting length of a subexpression can be determined before printing it The indent is kept within the object and can be incremented or decremented upon encountering nodes that require such a change newLineIndentOn: can then be used to directly print a newline and the current indent on a given bufferDifferent methods can be used for pretty pretty printing more on preferences can be found in the next section: Calling format: will use the default set of preferences format:preferences: allows tweaking the default settings before they are used userProfileFormat: will use the current global profile format:in:notifying and format:in:notifying:decorated: are called by the CodeHolders to get pretty printed text In practice only the supplied string prove to be relevant for us so we are ignoring all other parameters The PPPPSettingsProfileThe printer has a PPPSettingsProfile that can be tweaked or overriden Its settings are used during the printing processOn its class side all options are duplicated This is done to provide user settings inside the Squeak Preference Browser Having the duplicated options allows providing the preferences in the browser while also being able to override them eg in tests or later on on a per project basis Having a single global set of options on the other hand prove impractical for both the user and testingWhen an option on the class side is changed all CodeHolder subinstaces are asked to force refresh their contents resulting in a live preview of the settings change To suppress this behavior eg when loading a set of preferences call freezeCodeHolderRefreshThe class also allows the import and export of the profile to the filesystem via importUserProfileFromFileNamed: and exportUserProfileFromFileNamed:,1.0,HPI-SWA-Teaching/SWT16-Project-08,328.0,0.0,1.0,9.0

pressed----------------------The following sections explains all about the physical keyboardand the OS interrupts But a whole lot happens after that whichisnt explained When you just press g the browser receives theevent and the entire auto-complete machinery kicks into high gearDepending on your browsers algorithm and if you are inprivate/incognito mode or not various suggestions will be presentedto you in the dropbox below the URL bar Most of these algorithmsprioritize results based on search history and bookmarks You aregoing to type googlecom so none of it matters but a lot of codewill run before you get there and the suggestions will be refinedwith each key press It may even suggest googlecom before you type itThe enter key bottoms out---------------------------To pick a zero point lets choose the Enter key on the keyboard hitting thebottom of its range At this point an electrical circuit specific to the enterkey is closed either directly or capacitively This allows a small amount ofcurrent to flow into the logic circuitry of the keyboard which scans the stateof each key switch debounces the electrical noise of the rapid intermittentclosure of the switch and converts it to a keycode integer in this case 13The keyboard controller then encodes the keycode for transport to the computerThis is now almost universally over a Universal Serial Bus USB or Bluetoothconnection but historically has been over PS/2 or ADB connectionsIn the case of the USB keyboard:- The USB circuitry of the keyboard is powered by the 5V supply provided over  pin 1 from the computers USB host controller- The keycode generated is stored by internal keyboard circuitry memory in a  register called endpoint- The host USB controller polls that endpoint every 10ms minimum value  declared by the keyboard so it gets the keycode value stored on it- This value goes to the USB SIE Serial Interface Engine to be converted in  one or more USB packets that follows the low level USB protocol- Those packets are sent by a differential electrical signal over D and D-  pins the middle 2 at a maximum speed of 15 Mb/s as an HID  Human Interface Device device is always declared to be a low speed device  USB 20 compliance- This serial signal is then decoded at the computers host USB controller and  interpreted by the computers Human Interface Device HID universal keyboard  device driver  The value of the key is then passed into the operating  systems hardware abstraction layerIn the case of Virtual Keyboard as in touch screen devices:- When the user puts their finger on a modern capacitive touch screen a  tiny amount of current gets transferred to the finger This completes the  circuit through the electrostatic field of the conductive layer and  creates a voltage drop at that point on the screen The  screen controller then raises an interrupt reporting the coordinate of  the key press- Then the mobile OS notifies the current focused application of a press event  in one of its GUI elements which now is the virtual keyboard application  buttons- The virtual keyboard can now raise a software interrupt for sending a  key pressed message back to the OS- This interrupt notifies the current focused application of a key pressed  eventInterrupt fires NOT for USB keyboards---------------------------------------The keyboard sends signals on its interrupt request line IRQ which is mappedto an interrupt vector integer by the interrupt controller The CPU usesthe Interrupt Descriptor Table IDT to map the interrupt vectors tofunctions interrupt handlers which are supplied by the kernel When aninterrupt arrives the CPU indexes the IDT with the interrupt vector and runsthe appropriate handler Thus the kernel is enteredOn Windows A WMKEYDOWN message is sent to the app--------------------------------------------------------The HID transport passes the key down event to the KBDHIDsys driver whichconverts the HID usage into a scancode In this case the scan code isVKRETURN 0x0D The KBDHIDsys driver interfaces with theKBDCLASSsys keyboard class driver This driver is responsible forhandling all keyboard and keypad input in a secure manner It then calls intoWin32Ksys after potentially passing the message through 3rd partykeyboard filters that are installed This all happens in kernel modeWin32Ksys figures out what window is the active window through theGetForegroundWindow API This API provides the window handle of thebrowsers address box The main Windows message pump then callsSendMessagehWnd WMKEYDOWN VKRETURN lParam lParam is a bitmaskthat indicates further information about the keypress: repeat count 0 in thiscase the actual scan code can be OEM dependent but generally wouldnt befor VKRETURN whether extended keys eg alt shift ctrl were alsopressed they werent and some other stateThe Windows SendMessage API is a straightforward function thatadds the message to a queue for the particular window handle hWndLater the main message processing function called a WindowProc assignedto the hWnd is called in order to process each message in the queueThe window hWnd that is active is actually an edit control and theWindowProc in this case has a message handler for WMKEYDOWN messagesThis code looks within the 3rd parameter that was passed to SendMessagewParam and because it is VKRETURN knows the user has hit the ENTERkeyOn OS X A KeyDown NSEvent is sent to the app--------------------------------------------------The interrupt signal triggers an interrupt event in the I/O Kit kext keyboarddriver The driver translates the signal into a key code which is passed to theOS X WindowServer process Resultantly the WindowServer dispatches anevent to any appropriate eg active or listening applications through theirMach port where it is placed into an event queue Events can then be read fromthis queue by threads with sufficient privileges calling themachipcdispatch function This most commonly occurs through and ishandled by an NSApplication main event loop via an NSEvent ofNSEventType KeyDownOn GNU/Linux the Xorg server listens for keycodes---------------------------------------------------When a graphical X server is used X will use the generic eventdriver evdev to acquire the keypress A re-mapping of keycodes to scancodesis made with X server specific keymaps and rulesWhen the scancode mapping of the key pressed is complete the X serversends the character to the window manager DWM metacity i3 etc so thewindow manager in turn sends the character to the focused windowThe graphical API of the window  that receives the character prints theappropriate font symbol in the appropriate focused fieldParse URL--------- The browser now has the following information contained in the URL Uniform  Resource Locator:    - Protocol  http        Use Hyper Text Transfer Protocol    - Resource  /        Retrieve main index pageIs it a URL or a search term-----------------------------When no protocol or valid domain name is given the browser proceeds to feedthe text given in the address box to the browsers default web search engineIn many cases the url has a special piece of text appended to it to tell thesearch engine that it came from a particular browsers url barCheck HSTS list--------------- The browser checks its preloaded HSTS HTTP Strict Transport Security  list This is a list of websites that have requested to be contacted via  HTTPS only If the website is in the list the browser sends its request via HTTPS  instead of HTTP Otherwise the initial request is sent via HTTP  Note that a website can still use the HSTS policy without being in the  HSTS list  The first HTTP request to the website by a user will receive a  response requesting that the user only send HTTPS requests  However this  single HTTP request could potentially leave the user vulnerable to a  downgrade attack which is why the HSTS list is included in modern web  browsersConvert non-ASCII Unicode characters in hostname------------------------------------------------ The browser checks the hostname for characters that are not in a-z  A-Z 0-9 - or  Since the hostname is googlecom there wont be any but if there were  the browser would apply Punycode encoding to the hostname portion of the  URLDNS lookup---------- Browser checks if the domain is in its cache to see the DNS Cache in  Chrome go to chrome://net-internals/dns chrome://net-internals/dns If not found the browser calls gethostbyname library function varies by  OS to do the lookup gethostbyname checks if the hostname can be resolved by reference in the  local hosts file whose location varies by OS before trying to  resolve the hostname through DNS If gethostbyname does not have it cached nor can find it in the hosts  file then it makes a request to the DNS server configured in the network  stack This is typically the local router or the ISPs caching DNS server If the DNS server is on the same subnet the network library follows the  ARP process below for the DNS server If the DNS server is on a different subnet the network library follows  the ARP process below for the default gateway IPARP process-----------In order to send an ARP Address Resolution Protocol broadcast the networkstack library needs the target IP address to look up It also needs to know theMAC address of the interface it will use to send out the ARP broadcastThe ARP cache is first checked for an ARP entry for our target IP If it is inthe cache the library function returns the result: Target IP  MACIf the entry is not in the ARP cache: The route table is looked up to see if the Target IP address is on any of  the subnets on the local route table If it is the library uses the  interface associated with that subnet If it is not the library uses the  interface that has the subnet of our default gateway The MAC address of the selected network interface is looked up The network library sends a Layer 2 data link layer of the OSI model  ARP request:ARP Request::    Sender MAC: interface:mac:address:here    Sender IP: interfaceipgoeshere    Target MAC: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF Broadcast    Target IP: targetipgoeshereDepending on what type of hardware is between the computer and the router:Directly connected: If the computer is directly connected to the router the router responds  with an ARP Reply see belowHub: If the computer is connected to a hub the hub will broadcast the ARP  request out all other ports If the router is connected on the same wire  it will respond with an ARP Reply see belowSwitch: If the computer is connected to a switch the switch will check its local  CAM/MAC table to see which port has the MAC address we are looking for If  the switch has no entry for the MAC address it will rebroadcast the ARP  request to all other ports If the switch has an entry in the MAC/CAM table it will send the ARP request  to the port that has the MAC address we are looking for If the router is on the same wire it will respond with an ARP Reply  see belowARP Reply::    Sender MAC: target:mac:address:here    Sender IP: targetipgoeshere    Target MAC: interface:mac:address:here    Target IP: interfaceipgoeshereNow that the network library has the IP address of either our DNS server orthe default gateway it can resume its DNS process: Port 53 is opened to send a UDP request to DNS server if the response size  is too large TCP will be used instead If the local/ISP DNS server does not have it then a recursive search is  requested and that flows up the list of DNS servers until the SOA is reached  and if found an answer is returnedOpening of a socket-------------------Once the browser receives the IP address of the destination server it takesthat and the given port number from the URL the HTTP protocol defaults to port80 and HTTPS to port 443 and makes a call to the system library functionnamed socket and requests a TCP socket stream - AFINET/AFINET6 andSOCKSTREAM This request is first passed to the Transport Layer where a TCP segment is  crafted The destination port is added to the header and a source port is  chosen from within the kernels dynamic port range iplocalportrange in  Linux This segment is sent to the Network Layer which wraps an additional IP  header The IP address of the destination server as well as that of the  current machine is inserted to form a packet The packet next arrives at the Link Layer A frame header is added that  includes the MAC address of the machines NIC as well as the MAC address of  the gateway local router As before if the kernel does not know the MAC  address of the gateway it must broadcast an ARP query to find itAt this point the packet is ready to be transmitted through either: Ethernet WiFi Cellular data networkFor most home or small business Internet connections the packet will pass fromyour computer possibly through a local network and then through a modemMOdulator/DEModulator which converts digital 1s and 0s into an analogsignal suitable for transmission over telephone cable or wireless telephonyconnections On the other end of the connection is another modem which convertsthe analog signal back into digital data to be processed by the next networknode where the from and to addresses would be analyzed furtherMost larger businesses and some newer residential connections will have fiberor direct Ethernet connections in which case the data remains digital andis passed directly to the next network node for processingEventually the packet will reach the router managing the local subnet Fromthere it will continue to travel to the ASs border routers other ASes andfinally to the destination server Each router along the way extracts thedestination address from the IP header and routes it to the appropriate nexthop The TTL field in the IP header is decremented by one for each router thatpasses The packet will be dropped if the TTL field reaches zero or if thecurrent router has no space in its queue perhaps due to network congestionThis send and receive happens multiple times following the TCP connection flow: Client chooses an initial sequence number ISN and sends the packet to the  server with the SYN bit set to indicate it is setting the ISN Server receives SYN and if its in an agreeable mood:    Server chooses its own initial sequence number    Server sets SYN to indicate it is choosing its ISN    Server copies the client ISN 1 to its ACK field and adds the ACK flag     to indicate it is acknowledging receipt of the first packet Client acknowledges the connection by sending a packet:    Increases its own sequence number    Increases the receiver acknowledgment number    Sets ACK field Data is transferred as follows:    As one side sends N data bytes it increases its SEQ by that number    When the other side acknowledges receipt of that packet or a string of     packets it sends an ACK packet with the ACK value equal to the last     received sequence from the other To close the connection:    The closer sends a FIN packet    The other sides ACKs the FIN packet and sends its own FIN    The closer acknowledges the other sides FIN with an ACKTLS handshake------------- The client computer sends a ClientHello message to the server with its  TLS version list of cipher algorithms and compression methods available The server replies with a ServerHello message to the client with the  TLS version selected cipher selected compression methods and the servers  public certificate signed by a CA Certificate Authority The certificate  contains a public key that will be used by the client to encrypt the rest of  the handshake until a symmetric key can be agreed upon The client verifies the server digital certificate against its list of  trusted CAs If trust can be established based on the CA the client  generates a string of pseudo-random bytes and encrypts this with the servers  public key These random bytes can be used to determine the symmetric key The server decrypts the random bytes using its private key and uses these  bytes to generate its own copy of the symmetric master key The client sends a Finished message to the server encrypting a hash of  the transmission up to this point with the symmetric key The server generates its own hash and then decrypts the client-sent hash  to verify that it matches If it does it sends its own Finished message  to the client also encrypted with the symmetric key From now on the TLS session transmits the application HTTP data encrypted  with the agreed symmetric keyHTTP protocol-------------If the web browser used was written by Google instead of sending an HTTPrequest to retrieve the page it will send a request to try and negotiate withthe server an upgrade from HTTP to the SPDY protocolIf the client is using the HTTP protocol and does not support SPDY it sends arequest to the server of the form::    GET / HTTP/11    Host: googlecom    Connection: close    other headerswhere other headers refers to a series of colon-separated key-value pairsformatted as per the HTTP specification and separated by single new linesThis assumes the web browser being used doesnt have any bugs violating theHTTP spec This also assumes that the web browser is using HTTP/11otherwise it may not include the Host header in the request and the versionspecified in the GET request will either be HTTP/10 or HTTP/09HTTP/11 defines the close connection option for the sender to signal thatthe connection will be closed after completion of the response For example    Connection: closeHTTP/11 applications that do not support persistent connections MUST includethe close connection option in every messageAfter sending the request and headers the web browser sends a single blanknewline to the server indicating that the content of the request is doneThe server responds with a response code denoting the status of the request andresponds with a response of the form::    200 OK    response headersFollowed by a single newline and then sends a payload of the HTML content ofwwwgooglecom The server may then either close the connection or ifheaders sent by the client requested it keep the connection open to be reusedfor further requestsIf the HTTP headers sent by the web browser included sufficient information forthe web server to determine if the version of the file cached by the webbrowser has been unmodified since the last retrieval ie if the web browserincluded an ETag header it may instead respond with a request ofthe form::    304 Not Modified    response headersand no payload and the web browser instead retrieves the HTML from its cacheAfter parsing the HTML the web browser and server repeats this processfor every resource image CSS faviconico etc referenced by the HTML pageexcept instead of GET / HTTP/11 the request will beGET /URL relative to wwwgooglecom HTTP/11If the HTML referenced a resource on a different domain thanwwwgooglecom the web browser goes back to the steps involved inresolving the other domain and follows all steps up to this point for thatdomain The Host header in the request will be set to the appropriateserver name instead of googlecomHTTP Server Request Handle--------------------------The HTTPD HTTP Daemon server is the one handling the requests/responses onthe server side The most common HTTPD servers are Apache or nginx for Linuxand IIS for Windows The HTTPD HTTP Daemon receives the request The server breaks down the request to the following parameters:    HTTP Request Method either GET HEAD POST PUT     DELETE CONNECT OPTIONS or TRACE In the case of a URL     entered directly into the address bar this will be GET    Domain in this case - googlecom    Requested path/page in this case - / as no specific path/page was     requested / is the default path The server verifies that there is a Virtual Host configured on the server  that corresponds with googlecom The server verifies that googlecom can accept GET requests The server verifies that the client is allowed to use this method  by IP authentication etc If the server has a rewrite module installed like modrewrite for Apache or  URL Rewrite for IIS it tries to match the request against one of the  configured rules If a matching rule is found the server uses that rule to  rewrite the request The server goes to pull the content that corresponds with the request  in our case it will fall back to the index file as / is the main file  some cases can override this but this is the most common method The server parses the file according to the handler If Google  is running on PHP the server uses PHP to interpret the index file and  streams the output to the clientBehind the scenes of the Browser----------------------------------Once the server supplies the resources HTML CSS JS images etcto the browser it undergoes the below process: Parsing - HTML CSS JS Rendering - Construct DOM Tree  Render Tree  Layout of Render Tree   Painting the render treeBrowser-------The browsers functionality is to present the web resource you choose byrequesting it from the server and displaying it in the browser windowThe resource is usually an HTML document but may also be a PDFimage or some other type of content The location of the resource isspecified by the user using a URI Uniform Resource IdentifierThe way the browser interprets and displays HTML files is specifiedin the HTML and CSS specifications These specifications are maintainedby the W3C World Wide Web Consortium organization which is thestandards organization for the webBrowser user interfaces have a lot in common with each other Among thecommon user interface elements are: An address bar for inserting a URI Back and forward buttons Bookmarking options Refresh and stop buttons for refreshing or stopping the loading of  current documents Home button that takes you to your home pageBrowser High Level StructureThe components of the browsers are: User interface: The user interface includes the address bar  back/forward button bookmarking menu etc Every part of the browser  display except the window where you see the requested page Browser engine: The browser engine marshals actions between the UI  and the rendering engine Rendering engine: The rendering engine is responsible for displaying  requested content For example if the requested content is HTML the  rendering engine parses HTML and CSS and displays the parsed content on  the screen Networking: The networking handles network calls such as HTTP requests  using different implementations for different platforms behind a  platform-independent interface UI backend: The UI backend is used for drawing basic widgets like combo  boxes and windows This backend exposes a generic interface that is not  platform specific  Underneath it uses operating system user interface methods JavaScript engine: The JavaScript engine is used to parse and  execute JavaScript code Data storage: The data storage is a persistence layer The browser may  need to save all sorts of data locally such as cookies Browsers also  support storage mechanisms such as localStorage IndexedDB WebSQL and  FileSystemHTML parsing------------The rendering engine starts getting the contents of the requesteddocument from the networking layer This will usually be done in 8kB chunksThe primary job of HTML parser to parse the HTML markup into a parse treeThe output tree the parse tree is a tree of DOM element and attributenodes DOM is short for Document Object Model It is the object presentationof the HTML document and the interface of HTML elements to the outside worldlike JavaScript The root of the tree is the Document object Prior ofany manipulation via scripting the DOM has an almost one-to-one relation tothe markupThe parsing algorithmHTML cannot be parsed using the regular top-down or bottom-up parsersThe reasons are: The forgiving nature of the language The fact that browsers have traditional error tolerance to support well  known cases of invalid HTML The parsing process is reentrant For other languages the source doesnt  change during parsing but in HTML dynamic code such as script elements  containing documentwrite calls can add extra tokens so the parsing  process actually modifies the inputUnable to use the regular parsing techniques the browser utilizes a customparser for parsing HTML The parsing algorithm is described indetail by the HTML5 specificationThe algorithm consists of two stages: tokenization and tree constructionActions when the parsing is finishedThe browser begins fetching external resources linked to the page CSS imagesJavaScript files etcAt this stage the browser marks the document as interactive and startsparsing scripts that are in deferred mode: those that should beexecuted after the document is parsed The document state isset to complete and a load event is firedNote there is never an Invalid Syntax error on an HTML page Browsers fixany invalid content and go onCSS interpretation------------------ Parse CSS files style tag contents and style attribute  values using CSS lexical and syntax grammar Each CSS file is parsed into a StyleSheet object where each object  contains CSS rules with selectors and objects corresponding CSS grammar A CSS parser can be top-down or bottom-up when a specific parser generator  is usedPage Rendering-------------- Create a Frame Tree or Render Tree by traversing the DOM nodes and  calculating the CSS style values for each node Calculate the preferred width of each node in the Frame Tree bottom up  by summing the preferred width of the child nodes and the nodes  horizontal margins borders and padding Calculate the actual width of each node top-down by allocating each nodes  available width to its children Calculate the height of each node bottom-up by applying text wrapping and  summing the child node heights and the nodes margins borders and padding Calculate the coordinates of each node using the information calculated  above More complicated steps are taken when elements are floated  positioned absolutely or relatively or other complex features  are used See  http://devw3org/csswg/css2/ and http://wwww3org/Style/CSS/current-work  for more details Create layers to describe which parts of the page can be animated as a group  without being re-rasterized Each frame/render object is assigned to a layer Textures are allocated for each layer of the page The frame/render objects for each layer are traversed and drawing commands  are executed for their respective layer This may be rasterized by the CPU  or drawn on the GPU directly using D2D/SkiaGL All of the above steps may reuse calculated values from the last time the  webpage was rendered so that incremental changes require less work The page layers are sent to the compositing process where they are combined  with layers for other visible content like the browser chrome iframes  and addon panels Final layer positions are computed and the composite commands are issued  via Direct3D/OpenGL The GPU command buffers are flushed to the GPU for  asynchronous rendering and the frame is sent to the window serverGPU Rendering------------- During the rendering process the graphical computing layers can use general  purpose CPU or the graphical processor GPU as well When using GPU for graphical rendering computations the graphical  software layers split the task into multiple pieces so it can take advantage  of GPU massive parallelism for float point calculations required for  the rendering processWindow Server-------------Post-rendering and user-induced execution-----------------------------------------After rendering has completed the browser executes JavaScript code as a resultof some timing mechanism such as a Google Doodle animation or userinteraction typing a query into the search box and receiving suggestionsPlugins such as Flash or Java may execute as well although not at this time onthe Google homepage Scripts can cause additional network requests to beperformed as well as modify the page or its layout causing another round

loaded:javascriptif typeof jQuery  undefined   consolelogjQuery hasnt loaded else   consolelogjQuery has loadedNow youre offsupback to table of contentstable-of-contents/sup Use on Binding Instead of clickUsing on gives you several advantages over using click such as the ability to add multiple eventsjavascriptonclick tap hovera binding applies to dynamically created elements as well theres no need to manually bind every single element dynamically added to a DOM elementand the possibility to set a namespace:javascriptonclickmenuOpeningNamespaces give you the power to unbind a specific event eg offclickmenuOpeningsupback to table of contentstable-of-contents/sup Back to Top ButtonBy using the animate and scrollTop methods in jQuery you dont need a plugin to create a simple scroll-to-top animation:javascript// Back to topcontaineronclick back-to-top function e   epreventDefault  html bodyanimatescrollTop: 0 800html-- Create an anchor tag --div classcontainer  a href classback-to-topBack to top/a/divChanging the scrollTop value changes where you wants the scrollbar to land All youre really doing is animating the body of the document throughout the course of 800 milliseconds until it scrolls to the top of the documentNote: Watch for some buggy behaviorhttps://githubcom/jquery/apijquerycom/issues/417 with scrollTopsupback to table of contentstable-of-contents/sup Preload ImagesIf your web page uses a lot of images that arent visible initially eg on hover it makes sense to preload them:javascriptpreloadImages  function    for var i  0 i  argumentslength i     imgattrsrc argumentsi  preloadImagesimg/hover-onpng img/hover-offpngsupback to table of contentstable-of-contents/sup Checking If Images Are LoadedSometimes you might need to check if your images have fully loaded in order to continue on with your scripts:javascriptimgonload function    consolelogimage load successfulYou can also check if one particular image has loaded by replacing the img tag with an ID or classsupback to table of contentstable-of-contents/sup Fix Broken Images AutomaticallyIf you happen to find broken image links on your site replacing them one by one can be a pain This simple piece of code can save a lot of headaches:javascriptimgonerror function    ifthishasClassbroken-image     thispropsrc img/brokenpngaddClassbroken-image  Alternatively if you wish to simply hide broken images this snippet will take care of that for:javascriptimgonerror function    thishidesupback to table of contentstable-of-contents/sup Post a Form with AJAXjQuery AJAX methods are a common way to request text HTML XML or JSON If you wanted to send a form via AJAX you could collect the user inputs via the val method:javascriptpostsignupphp   username: inputnameusernameval  email:     inputnameemailval  password:  inputnamepasswordvalHowever all of those val calls are expensive A better way of collecting the user inputs is using the serialize function which collects the user inputs as a string:javascriptpostsignup sign-up-formserializesupback to table of contentstable-of-contents/sup Toggle Classes on HoverLets say you want to change the visual of a clickable element on your page when a user hovers over it You can add a class to your element when the user is hovering when the user stops hovering removes the class:javascriptbtnonhover function    thisaddClasshover function    thisremoveClasshoverYou just need to add the necessary CSS If you want an even simpler way use the toggleClass method:javascriptbtnonhover function    thistoggleClasshoverNote: CSS may be a faster solution in this case but its still worthwhile to know thissupback to table of contentstable-of-contents/sup Disabling Input FieldsAt times you may want the submit button of a form or one of its text inputs to be disabled until the user has performed a certain action eg checking the Ive read the terms checkbox Add the disabled attribute to your input so you can enable it when you want:javascriptinputtypesubmitpropdisabled trueAll you need to do is run the prop method again on the input but set the value of disabled to false:javascriptinputtypesubmitpropdisabled falsesupback to table of contentstable-of-contents/sup Stop the Loading of LinksSometimes you dont want links to go to a certain web page nor reload the page you might want them to do something else like trigger some other script This will do the trick of preventing the default action:javascriptano-linkonclick function e   epreventDefaultsupback to table of contentstable-of-contents/sup Cache jQuery SelectorsThink of how many times you write the same selector over and over again in any project Every element selector has to search the entire DOM each time regardless if that selector had previously run Instead run the selector once and store the results in a variable:javascriptvar blocks  blocksfindliNow you can use the blocks variable wherever you want without having to search the DOM every time:javascripthideBlocksonclick function    blocksfadeOutshowBlocksonclick function    blocksfadeInCaching jQuery selectors are an easy performance gainsupback to table of contentstable-of-contents/sup Toggle Fade/SlideSliding and fading are something we use plenty in our animations with jQuery You might just want to show an element when a user clicks something which makes the fadeIn and slideDown methods perfect But if you want that element to appear on the first click and then disappear on the second this will work just fine:javascript// Fadebtnonclick function    elementfadeToggleslow// Togglebtnonclick function    elementslideToggleslowsupback to table of contentstable-of-contents/sup Simple AccordionThis is a simple method for a quick accordion:javascript// Close all panelsaccordionfindcontenthide// Accordionaccordionfindaccordion-headeronclick function    var next  thisnext  nextslideTogglefast

Two Divs the Same HeightSometimes youll want two divs to have the same height no matter what content they have in them:javascriptdivcssmin-height main-divheightThis example sets the min-height which means that it can be bigger than the main div but never smaller However a more flexible method would be to loop over a set of elements and set the height to the height of the tallest element:javascriptvar columns  columnvar height  0columnseachfunction    if thisheight  height     height  thisheight  columnsheightheightIf you want all columns to have the same height:javascriptvar rows  same-height-columnsrowseachfunction    thisfindcolumnheightthisheightNote: This can be done several ways in CSShttp://codepenio/AllThingsSmitty/pen/KMPqoO but depending on what your needs are

calls to mitigate the process of repeatedly querying the DOM and creating multiple jQuery objects Lets say the following snippet represents your plugin method calls:javascriptelemshowelemhtmlblaelemotherStuffThis could be vastly improved by using chaining:javascriptelem  show  htmlbla  otherStuffAn alternative is to cache the element in a variable prefixed with :javascriptvar elem  elemelemhideelemhtmlblaelemotherStuffBoth chaining and cachingcache-jquery-selectors methods in jQuery are best practices that lead to shorter and faster codesupback to table

a new or undocumented process is uncontrolled reactive and unpredictable typically driven by individuals without coordination or communication Success depends on individual heroics2 Managed - a process is partially documented possibly leading to consistent results Success depends on discipline3 Defined - a process is documented standardized and integrated into other processes Success depends on automation4 Measured - the process is quantitatively managed Success depends on measuring metrics against business goals5 Optimized - the process is continually and reliably improving through both incremental and innovative changes Success depends on reducing the risk of change Potential applications of the Maturity ModelThe maturity model is being developed with two primary goals in mind:- Evaluating how GitHub products programs services and resources are helping customers develop more mature practices around open source- Creating a comprehensive starter kit that includes all the resources needed to use contribute to release and manage open source projects on GitHub Current StatusThe maturity model is currently a very early concept and actively being developed Sticky Notes for brainstorming the activities involved in open sourcehttps://stickiesio/boards/564eda3fefefba0b2fe8a0721 Bookmarks primary sources and notes are being gathered in an Evernote notebookhttps://wwwevernotecom/pub/bkeepers/maturitymodel Credits- Wikipedia: Capability Maturity Modelhttps://enwikipediaorg/wiki/CapabilityMaturityModel- Martin Fowler: MaturityModelhttp://martinfowlercom/bliki/MaturityModelhtml LicenseCopyright  2016 GitHub Inc and Contributors This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 40 International Licensehttp://creativecommonsorg/licenses/by/40/,0.0,github/maturity-model,1623.0,16.0,0.0,9.0

-verordnungenim Markdown-Formathttp://daringfireballnet/projects/markdown/ Als Quelledienen die XML-Versionen der Gesetze vonwwwgesetze-im-internetdehttp://wwwgesetze-im-internetde/Warum Git----------Jeder Brger kann den aktuellen Stand von Gesetzen sehr einfach online findenAllerdings ist die Entstehung die historische Entwicklung und dieAktualisierung von Gesetzen nicht einfach und frei nachvollziehbar Das liegtdaran dass Gesetze nur in ihrer aktuellsten Version prsentiert werden undnderungen an diesen Gesetzen nicht maschinenlesbar vorliegen Dies soll hiergendert werden: die aktuellste Version eines Gesetzes wird hier mit Gitversioniert gespeichert Das erlaubt es die Mchtigkeit von Git auf Gesetzeund auf den Gesetzgebungsprozess anzuwenden Das Einpflegen der komplettendeutschen Gesetzesvergangenheit in Git ist das ferne ZielWarum Markdown---------------Gesetze sind Prosa sie enthalten keine maschinenlesbare Semantik EineAuszeichnungssprache wie XML verringert die Menschenlesbarkeit erschwert diemaschinelle Erkennung von Unterschieden und beinhaltet viel berflssigeSyntaxMarkdown ist eine intuitive Formatierung von Text die ohne zustzlicheProgramme fr Menschen les- und schreibbar ist Das passt zu Gesetzestextendie nur minimale Formatierung bentigen Weiterhin lsst sich Markdown inandere Formate wie HTML konvertieren und ist damit maschinen-formatierbarPull Requests-------------Pull Requests knnen gerne geffnet werden Natrlich werden nur solchegemergt die tatschlich vom Bundestag verabschiedet wurden und Gesetzgeworden sindDennoch sind nderungsvorschlge an Gesetzen von Parteien oder aus derZivilgesellschaft als Pull Request ntzlich Die nderungen lassen sicheinfacher im Kontext verstehen knnen direkt am Gesetz diskutiert undnachvollziehbar verndert werdenOffizielle Gesetzesentwrfe wenn ffentlich verfgbar werden vom Fork derBundesregierunghttps://githubcom/bundesregierung/ als Pull Request andieses Repository gestelltFehler und Bitte um Mithilfe----------------------------Es wird kein Anspruch auf Korrektheit erhoben Bitte verlassen Sie sich nurauf offizielle QuellenDie XML-Quelle ist nicht fehlerfrei und die Konvertierung von XML nachMarkdown ist es auch nicht Das liegt daran dass die Gesetze im XML-Formatdas Markup auch fr stilistische Auszeichnungen statt nur fr semantischeAuszeichnungen nutzen Dies erschwert eine Konvertierung und fhrt zufehlerhaftem Markdown Da fehlerhaftes Markdown immer noch gut lesbar istfhrt dies erst bei einer Weiterverarbeitung zu ProblemenCommits richten sich nach Mglichkeit nach den Verffentlichungen imBundesgesetzblatt und im Amtlichen Teil des Bundesanzeigers Das funktioniertnicht immer problemlos und erfordert menschliche UntersttzungWerkzeuge die die Aktualisierung vereinfachen finden sich imgesetze-tools repositoryhttps://githubcom/bundestag/gesetze-toolsMithilfe ist erwnschtUm die Fhigkeiten von Git optimal zu nutzen wird es ntig sein Commits dieGesetzesnderungen einbringen von Commits die zB Korrekturen an der Syntaxvornehmen oder die README verndern zu unterscheiden Hier wird um Mithilfebei der Ausarbeitung eines Git-Workflowshttps://githubcom/bundestag/gesetze/wiki/Git-Workflowfr dieses Repostiory gebetenRechtliches-----------Gesetze sind amtliche Werke und unterliegen nicht dem UrheberrechtKontakt-------Twitter: bundesgithttps://twittercom/bundesgit--------english versionGerman Federal Laws and RegulationsThis Git repository contains all German federal laws and regulations inMarkdown formathttp://daringfireballnet/projects/markdown/ The sourceis the XML version of the laws fromwwwgesetze-im-internetdehttp://wwwgesetze-im-internetde/Why Git----------All German citizens can easily find an up-to-date version of their laws onlineHowever the legislation process the historic evolution and the updates to lawsare not easily and freely trackable The reason is that laws are only publishedin their most recent version and changes to laws are not available in amachine-readable formatThis should change: the current state of laws will be stored in this repositoryunder Git version control This allows the power of Git to be applied to thelegislation process Integrating the whole history of German law changes in Gitis the ambitious goalWhy Markdown-------------Laws are prose they do not contain machine-readable semanticsA complex markup language like XML reduces the human-readabilitymakes detection of differences harder and contains lots ofunnecessary syntaxMarkdown is an intuitive formatting of text that is readable andwritable by humans without the need of additional tools That fitsthe nature of laws that only need minimal formatting FurthermoreMarkdown is machine-formattable and can be converted to other formatslike HTMLPull Requests-------------You are encouraged to open pull request Of course only valid legislationvoted on by the Bundestag will be mergedHowever law change proposals as pull requests coming from parties orNGOs can be useful to understand context discuss changes directly wherethey will happen and keep changes accountableOfficial change proposals from our government will be opened as pullrequests from the fork of the Bundesregierunghttps://githubcom/bundesregierung/as they become publicy availableMistakes and call for help--------------------------There is no guarantee on correctness Please only trust official sourcesThe source XML is not without mistakes and neither is the conversion toMarkdown Thats because the source XML uses markup for style and not onlyfor semantics This makes conversion harder and comes down to faultyMarkdown However faulty Markdown is still very readable and will onlycause problems when processed furtherCommits will be based on published changes Bundesgesetzblatt and BundesanzeigerThat doesnt work without problems and requires human interactionTools that make updates easier can be found in thegesetze-tools repositoryhttps://githubcom/bundestag/gesetze-toolsHelp neededIn order to make the most out of Git we need to distinguish between law changecommits and commits that fix eg syntax mistakesPlease help shape a Git Workflowhttps://githubcom/bundestag/gesetze/wiki/Git-Workflowfor this repositoryLegal Stuff-----------All laws are offical works and are not under copyright

notices the Open Exoplanet Catalogue has been in a a dorment state for a few months recieving only few updates This is mainly due to a lack of contributors In the fall we plan to have about 100 undegraduates in computer science work on the OEC Their main goal will be to implement an automated way to gather data from various sources on the internet We will keep the data fully referenced so that it is easy to find out where the data is coming from We will also allow for manual edits of the accumulated data as it has been in the past All of these things together should make the OEC the most complete and most up-to-date exoplanet catalogue out there In the meantime please keep your pull request coming -- Hanno Rein -- June 2016 About the Open Exoplanet

degree Errors-------------Uncertainties can be added to values using the following attributes of the tag We assume that these uncertainties represent the standard error of the measurement 682 confidence level However keep in mind that it is often not possible to collapse an entire posterior distribution to a single numberThe syntax for error bars is: mass errorminus01 errorplus0110/massThe syntax for upper/lower limits is: mass upperlimit10 /Constants-------------There are several constant used in defining the units in the Open Exoplanet Catalogue The following table can be used to convert them into SI units Constant used in catalogue  Definition in SI units  --------  ---------------  Jupiter mass  18991766e27 kg  Solarmass  19891e30 kg  Jupiter radius  69911000 m  Solarradius

PlotPeriod ratioshttps://rawgithubcom/OpenExoplanetCatalogue/oecplots/master/plotperiodratiosvgpng PlotTo create custom plots please visit this repositoryhttps://githubcom/OpenExoplanetCatalogue/oecplots for example scriptsDownload ASCII tables--------------A few words of caution: Many planetary systems are part of binary star systems The architecture of these systems is correctly represented in the original XML files of the Open Exoplanet Catalogue In fact it is to my knowledge the only catalogue that can do that However you might prefer to work with a simpler comma or tab separated table instead of the hierarchical XML file format During the conversion process some information is inevitably lost Most importantly the architecture of the star system One cannot easily represent an arbitrary binary/triple/quadruple system in a simple table Additionally if planets have multiple identifiers only the first identifier is outputted Using the original XML file format and git you can use the git blame functionality to find references to scientific publications for every numeric value in the database This functionality is also lost in the conversion processIn a separate repositoryhttps://githubcom/OpenExoplanetCatalogue/oectables/ you will find a comma separatedhttps://githubcom/OpenExoplanetCatalogue/oectables/raw/master/commaseparated/openexoplanetcataloguetxt and a tab separatedhttps://githubcom/OpenExoplanetCatalogue/oectables/blob/master/tabseparated/openexoplanetcataloguetxt ASCII table of the Open Exoplanet Catalogue Documentation--------------This filehttps://rawgithubcom/OpenExoplanetCatalogue/openexoplanetcatalogue/master/oecpaperpdf describes the philosophy and data-format of the catalogue However everything should be rather self-explanatory The actual data is in the systems directory Each XML file corresponds to one planetary system If you are editing the file with vim have a look at the xmledit pluginhttp://wwwvimorg/scripts/scriptphpscriptid301 I found it very helpfulHow to include references to publications--------------It seems that the most elegant place to put references to publications is the commit messageThis allows one to trace back each individual value in the database to the source using git blame Furthermore it does not add any additional clutter to the text files themselvesSo when committing any changes please create one commit per publication and include the reference in the commit message from now onDerived products--------------The following list contains links to other

that the performance of Git and GitHub when dealing withvery large repositories is still less than ideal It appears to be a probleminherent to Git and its indexing processesWhich is to say: Everything still works but it can be slow In practice this hasthe side-effect of making some features of GitHub like pull requests nearlyimpossible because the web application is configured to time out before indexingof a very large repository has completedThere is a good thread about the problem and some potential solutions over here:http://threadgmaneorg/gmanecompversion-controlgit/189776See Anything

by Marcin Ignac/Variablehttp://variableio/ Bettina Nissen and Kirill KulikovWe are also inviting you to create GitHub Issueshttps://githubcom/tategallery/collection/issues if you notice any bugs or have any ideas for improving the data Thanks for your help Repository ContentsWe offer two data formats:1 A richer dataset is provided in the JSON format which is organised by the directory structure of the Git repository JSON supports more hierarchical or nested information such as subjects2 We also provide CSVs of flattened data which is less comprehensive but perhaps easier to grok The CSVs provide a good introduction to overall contents of the Tate metadata and create opportunities for artistic pivot tables JSON ArtistsEach artist has his or her own JSON file They are found in the artists folder then filed away by first letter of the artists surname ArtworksArtworks are found in the artworks folder They are filed away by accession number This is the unique identifier given to artworks when they come into the Tate collection In many cases the format has significance For example the ar accession number prefix indicates that the artwork is part of ARTIST ROOMS collection The n prefix indicates works that once were part of the National Galleryhttp://wwwnationalgalleryorguk/ collection CSVThere is one CSV file for artists artistdatacsv and one very large for artworks artworkdatacsv which we may one day break up into more manageable chunks The CSV headings should be helpful Let us know if not Entrepreneurial hackers could use the CSVs as an index to the JSON collections if they wanted richer data NB CSV files are encoded as UTF-8 text on which older versions of Excel may choke We have inserted a UTF-8 BOM to help Excel detect the encoding which may or may not be a terrible mistake a nameusage/aUsage guidelines for open data  These usage guidelines are based on goodwill They are not a legal contract but Tate requests that you follow these guidelines if

covered in CPSC 120 introduce Object OrientedProgramming and prepare students for the material covered in CPSC 131 Learning GoalsTo be proficient in all listed standards Required Texts and Other Required MaterialsNo materials books etc are required  Access to a personal computer onwhich to do homework assignments is strongly recommended  If you wish for abook the one I will be referencing is Starting Out with C: Early Objects8th ed by Gaddis Walters and Muganda which you may already have from CPSC120 Etiquette Classroom ExpectationsPersonal electronics shall not be used in either lecture or lab unless theyare silent lying flat on your desk and being used solely to take notes and/orrecord the lecture with the permission of all present  Non-personalelectronics shall be used solely for the completion of assigned work and shallalso in all cases be silent and used as unobtrusively as possibleCommunication including body language and general attitude are expected to berespectful at all times  Everyone present is also expected to be focused andparticipating in the current classroom activityIf you are unable or do not wish to abide by these rules you may be asked toleave Grading MethodThe grading for this course will be standards based  This means that yourgrade will depend on demonstrating competency on a number of standardsrather than on your performance on any particular test quiz or homeworkassignment Homework and Lab AssignmentsHomework and lab assignments will be commented on for feedback but the onlyscore that will be recorded is whether or not the assignment was completedYou are encouraged to work together with other students but discouraged fromusing material generated by anyone outside our class  You are required toclearly document the source of any code algorithm information etc that youuse or reference while completing your work  You are also required toexplicitly state the copyright and license under which you release your codeYour percentage score for homework and lab assignments will be the percentageof homework and lab assignments completed Quizzes and TestsQuizzes and tests will be given primarily on paper but may be posted to thecourse GitHub page  Applicable standards will be listed and you willreceive a grade for each as follows: score  description :------:------------1     not enough information to assess2     you have heard of the skill3     you understand and can apply the skill at a basic level35   you are between basic competency and mastery375  you have mastered the skill but your presentation has trivial errors4     you have mastered the skillMost standards will be assessed several times  I will look at the trend ofthese assessments and use my judgment to assign you an overall grade for eachstandardCurrently though I reserve the right to change this without notice this isimplemented by taking the two most recent assessments and applying thefollowing heuristic:- If the most recent is greater than or equal to the next most recent that is  your overall grade- If the most recent is less than the next most recent I average them and  round up to the next highest valid gradeIf the overall grade for any standard is less than 3 the percentage score forthat standard will be 0  Otherwise the percentage score for that standardwill be the overall grade divided by 4 Extra CreditFor each programming error I make in code posted on the course GitHub pagethe first person to submit a pull request for a correct well written and wellformated fix will receive 2 extra credit pointsFor each non-programming error I make in anything posed on the course GitHubpage the first person to submit a pull request for a correct well writtenand well formatted fix will receive 1 extra credit pointFor materials written and distributed by me in relation to this class that arenot posted to the course GitHub page extra credit will be given in thesame amounts as above to the first person to present a correct well writtenand well formatted fix to me via some other meansOther opportunities for extra credit points may be offered throughout thecourse  See extra creditEach extra credit point will add 02 to your final grade Conversion to Letter GradeEach group will be weighted as shown in standards and standards withineach group will be weighted equally unless otherwise noted  Percentage pointsdue to extra credit will be added and the resulting percentage will beconverted to a letter grade as follows written in Python 3:pythondef letterpercent:    if   percent  97: return A    elif percent  93: return A    elif percent  90: return A-    elif percent  87: return B    elif percent  83: return B    elif percent  80: return B-    elif percent  77: return C    elif percent  70: return C    elif percent  50: return D    else              : return FNote that plus/minus grading is only used for grades above C  Note also thatComputer Science majors must earn a grade of C or higher in this course toreceive credit if a lower grade is earned the course will have to berepeated  Please keep all assignments and exams returned to you so that anydiscrepancies can be easily and fairly corrected  Except in cases of actualerror on my part final grades will not be changed Late AssignmentsLate assignments will not be accepted for credit  However when I grade anassignment I will grade the most recent version that I have on hand Alternative Procedure for Submitting WorkIn case of technical difficulties with GitHub assignment due dates will bepostponed or an alternate method of submission will be communicated  In thecase of an emergency that disrupts normal campus operations or causes theUniversity to close for a prolonged period of time due to circumstances such asan earthquake we will continue our class online via methods to becommunicated  In the case of a simultaneous internet outage effecting myselfor the majority of the class you are requested to continue studying accordingto the tentative schedule classes may well be canceled but learning onyour own will give you the opportunity to challenge the course when theUniversity reopens AttendanceI reserve the right to drop you from the course if you are absent withoutnotifying either me or the departmental office within 24 hours after anymeeting missed during the first week of classes or if you do not meet thecourse prerequisitesI expect you to be present for the entirety of the first meeting and for rollcall during the first week  Apart from this attendance is not required norwill roll be taken University Information Students with Special NeedsPlease inform the instructor during the first week of classes about anydisability or special needs that you may have that may require specificarrangements related to attending class sessions carrying out classassignments or writing papers or examinations  According to California StateUniversity policy students with disabilities must document their disabilitiesat the Disability Support Services DSS Office in order to be accommodated intheir courses  Additional information can be found at the DDS websitehttp://wwwfullertonedu/dss/ by calling 657-278-3112 or by

academicdishonesty  It usually involves an attempt by a student to show a possessionof a level of knowledge or skill which he/she in fact does not possessCheating is defined as the act of obtaining or attempting to obtain credit forwork by the use of any dishonest deceptive fraudulent or unauthorized meansPlagiarism is defined as the act of taking the work of another and offering itas ones own without giving credit to that source  An instructor who believesthat an act of academic dishonesty has occurred 1 is obligated to discuss thematter with the students involved 2 should possess reasonable evidencesuch as documents or personal observation and 3 may take whatever actionsubject to student appeal he/she deems appropriate ranging from an oralreprimand to an F in the course

members and alumn started The book reads very wellis full of information and the lab walkthroughs in the back are invaluable We didnt want to re-invent the wheel sowe structured most of the class around the book Students were expected to have read the relevant PMA book chaptersbefore class allowing us to spend much more class time demonstrating skills and techniques and walking throughhands-on examples with the studentsSyllabus: http://securitycsrpiedu/courses/malware-fall2015/SyllabuspdfNote: Most of the samples used in this course are malicious in nature treat them carefullyTo help protect people from accidentaly running samples on an important machine and to prevent anti-malware suites fromblocking the course material all of the samples are compressed and encrypted with a password of infected Course AbstractWith the increased use of the Internet and prevalence of computing systems in critical infrastructure technology is undoubtedly a vital part of modern daily life Unfortunately the increasingly networked nature of the modern world has also enabled the spread of malicious software or malware ranging from annoying adware to advanced nation-state sponsored cyber-weaponry As a result the ability to detect analyze understand control and eradicate malware is an increasingly important issue of economic and national securityThis course will introduce students to modern malware analysis techniques through readings and hands-on interactive analysis of real-world samples After taking this course students will be equipped with the skills to analyze advanced contemporary malware using both static and dynamic analysis Prerequisite KnowledgeThis course carried a prereq ofComputer Organization - CSCI

Analysis EnvironmentSetting up a safe and usable analysis environment can range from easy to impossibledepending on how far you want to go The PMA book devotes anentire chapter Chapter 2 to this problem For the purposes of this class wedecided to set up a Windows 7 32-bit virtual machine Unfortunately while all the softwarewe used for the class is free Windows is not thus we cannot distribute this VM like wedistributed the Warzone for MBE We have however included a comprehensive list and acollection of installers of all the tools we used throughout the course There are a few essentials that we havent listed but are still included in the installer package python cygwin etcVisit the releaseshttps://githubcom/RPISEC/Malware/releases page for the latest package Tools Dependency

malicious/dangerousYes Not all of them are malicious in nature but most are Always keep them inside aproper analysis environment Why are the lecture slides for XYZ so sparseMuch of lecture time was spent in hands on examples with the expectation that studentshad read the material in the PMA book ahead of time Thus the slide content referringto material from the PMA book is meant as more of an outline Read the chapters and thengo through the lab walkthroughs in the back of the PMA book they are a great resource Do you have videos of the lecturesSadly we did not record any of the lectures

EnvironmentIf you have jekyll installed simply run jekyll serve in Command Lineand preview the themes in your browser You can use jekyll serve --watch to watch for changes in the source files as well Get StartedYou can easily get started by modifying configyml: Site settingstitle: Hux Blog              title of your websiteSEOTitle: Hux Blog check out docs for more detaildescription: Cool Blog      SNS settings      githubusername: huxpro      modify this account to yoursweibousername: huxpro       the footer woule be auto-updated Build settings paginate: 10               nums of posts in one pageThere are more options you can check out in the Jekyll - Official Sitehttp://jekyllrbcom/ or you can directly dive into code to find more Write PostsFeel free to checkout Markdown files in the posts/ you will quickly realized how to post your articles with magical markdown plus this nice themeThe front-matter of a post looks like that:---layout:     posttitle:      Hello 2015subtitle:   Hello World Hello Blogdate:       2015-01-29 12:00:00author:     Huxheader-img: img/post-bg-2015jpgtags:    - Life--- SideBarhttp://huangxuanme/img/blog-sidebarjpgSeeing more information may be necessary for you to display from V11 a clean gorgeous SideBar is added for you which provide more area for displaying possible modules You can enable it is default enable this feature by simply config: Sidebar settingssidebar: truesidebar-about-description: your description heresidebar-avatar: /img/avatar-huxjpg      use absolute URLWe default support Featured Tagsfeatured-tags Mini About Memini-about-me and Friendsfriends these three modules and you can add your own The sidebar is naturally responsive and would be push to bottom in a small screen size  992px according to Bootstarp Grid Systemhttp://getbootstrapcom/css/grid  More details of these three separate modules are talking below Mini About MeMini-About-Me module display all your SNS buttons also your avatar and the description if you set sidebar-avatar and sidebar-about-description which is very useful and common for a sidebar so it is default with your sidebarIt is really nice-looking and well-designed It would be hidden in a small screen seeing the sidebar would be push to bottom and there is already a footer including SNS feature which is similar Featured TagsConsidering the Featured-Tags feature in Mediumhttp://mediumcom is pretty cool so I add it in my blog theme also   This module is independent of sidebar from V14 so it can definitely live without enable sidebar which would be displayed in the bottom when sidebar set to false and it is not only displayed in home page but also every post page bottom Featured Tagsfeatured-tags: true  featured-condition-size: 1      A tag will be featured if the size of it is more than this condition valueThe only one thing need to be paid attention to is the featured-condition-size: A tag will be featured if the size of it is more than this condition value  Internally a condition template  if tag1size  sitefeatured-condition-size  is used to do the filter FriendsFriends is a very common feature of a blog seeing the SEO so I add it in V11 release to help that   Friends can also live without enable sidebar also be displayed in the bottom when sidebar unable and be displayed in every post page bottomYou can just add your friends information in configyml with a familiar JSON syntax and everything is done very easy: Friendsfriends:             title: Foo Blog        href: http://foogithubio/                title: Bar Blog        href: http://bargithubio     Keynote Layouthttp://huangxuanme/img/blog-keynotejpgThere is a increasing tendency to use Open Web technology to create keynotes presentations like Revealjs Impressjs Slides Prezi etc I consider a modern blog should have abilities to post these HTML based presentation easily also abilities to play it directlyUnder the hood a iframe is used to include webpage from outer source so the only things left is to give a url in the front-matter:---layout:     keynoteiframe:     http://huangxuanme/js-module-7day/---The iframe will be automatically resized to adapt different form factors also the device orientation A padding is left to imply user that there has more content below also to ensure that there is a area for user to scroll down in mobile device seeing most of the keynote framework prevent the browser default scroll behavior CommentThis theme support both Disqushttp://disquscom and Duoshuohttp://duoshuocom as the third party discussion systemFirst you need to sign up and get your own account Repeat DO NOT use mine I have set Trusted Domains It is deathly simple to sign up and you will get the full power of management system Please give it a trySecond from V15 you can easily complete your comment configuration by just adding your short name into configyml:duoshuousername: yourduoshuoshortname ORdisqususername: yourdisqusshortnameTo the old version user its better that you pull the new version otherwise you have to replace code in posthtml keynotehtml and abouthtml by yourselvesFurthermore Duoshuo support Sharing if you only wanna use Duoshuo comment without sharing you can set duoshuoshare: false You can use Duoshuo Sharing and Disqus Comments together also AnalyticsFrom V15 we support Google Analytics and Baidu Tongji officially with a deathly simple config: Baidu Analyticsbatrackid: 4cc1f2d8f3067386cc5cdb626a202900 Google Analyticsgatrackid: UA-49627206-1             Format: UA-xxxxxx-xxgadomain: huangxuanmeJust checkout the code offered by Google/Baidu and copy paste here all the rest is already done for youGoogle might ask for meta tag google-site-verification CustomizationIf you wanna do more customization and change code yourself a Gruntgruntjscom environment is also included Thanks to Clean BlogThere are a number of tasks it performs like minification of the JavaScript compiling of the LESS files adding banners to keep the Apache 20 license intact and watching for changes Run the grunt default task by entering grunt  into your command line which will build the files You can use grunt watch if you are working on the JavaScript or the LESSTry to understand code in include/ and layouts/ then you can modify Jekyll Liquidhttps://githubcom/Shopify/liquid/wiki template directly to do more creative customization Header ImageChange header images of any pages or any posts is pretty easy as mentioned above But thanks to issue 6 in Chinesehttps://githubcom/Huxpro/huxprogithubio/issues/6 asked how to make it looks greatWellit is actually a design issue not a coding stuff It is better that you have basic design knowledge but not is ok let me told you how to make it well-designed:Seeing the title text above image is white the image should be dark to emphasize the contract so we can easily add a black overlay with fews of opacity which is depends on the brightness of the original images you used you can process it in Photoshop Sketch etcIn technical views it can be done with CSS However the opacity of the black overlay is really hard to assigned every image has different brightness so the  degree it should be adjusted is different so it is impossible to hard code it SEO TitleBefore V14 site setting title is not only used for displayed in Home Page and Navbar but also used to generate the title in HTMLIts possible that you want the two things different For me my site-title is Hux Blog but I want the title shows in search engine is   Hux Blog which is multi-languageSo the SEO Title is introduced to solve this problem you can set SEOTitle different from title and it would be only used to generate HTML title and setting DuoShuo Sharing Page Build WarningThere are many possible reasons to cause a Page Build Warning email or similar errorOne of these is that github changes its build environment You are attempting to use the pygments highlighter which is currently unsupported on GitHub Pages Your site will use rouge for highlighting instead To suppress this warning change the highlighter value to rouge in your configymlSo just edit configyml find highlighter: pygments change it to highlighter: rouge and the warning will be goneFor other circumstances check out existing issues or create a new one LicenseApache License 20Copyright c 2015-2016 HuxproHux Blog is derived from Clean

the documentation and/or website for KubernetesYou can click the Fork button in the upper-right area of the screen to create a copy of our site on your GitHub account called a fork Make any changes you want in your fork and when you are ready to send those changes to us go to the index page for your fork and click New Pull Request to let us know about itFor more information about contributing to the Kubernetes documentation see: Creating a Documentation Pull Requesthttp://kubernetesio/docs/contribute/create-pull-request/ Writing a New Topichttp://kubernetesio/docs/contribute/write-new-topic/ Staging Your Documentation Changeshttp://kubernetesio/docs/contribute/stage-documentation-changes/ Using Page Templateshttp://kubernetesio/docs/contribute/page-templates/ Automatic Staging for Pull RequestsWhen you create a pull request either against master or the upcoming release your changes are staged in a custom subdomain on Netlify so that you can see your changes in rendered form before the PR is merged You can use this to verify that everything is correct before the PR gets merged To view your changes:- Scroll down to the PRs list of Automated Checks- Click Show All Checks- Look for deploy/netlify youll see Deploy Preview Ready if staging was successful- Click Details to bring up the staged site and navigate to your changes Branch structure and stagingThe current version of the website is served out of the master branch To make changes to the live docs such as bug fixes broken links typos etc target your pull request to the master branchThe release-1x branch stores changes for upcoming releases of Kubernetes For example the release-15 branch has changes for the 15 release These changes target branches and not master to avoid publishing documentation updates prior to the release for which theyre relevant If you have a change for an upcoming release of Kubernetes target your pull request to the appropriate release branchThe staging site for the next upcoming Kubernetes release is here: http://kubernetes-io-vnext-stagingnetlifycom/http://kubernetes-io-vnext-stagingnetlifycom/ The staging site reflects the current state of whats been merged in the release branch or in other words what the docs will look like for the next upcoming release Its automatically updated as new PRs get merged Staging the site locally using DockerDont like installing stuff Download and run a local staging server with a single docker run command    git clone https://githubcom/kubernetes/kubernetesgithubiogit    cd kubernetesgithubio    docker run -ti --rm -v PWD:/k8sdocs -p 4000:4000 gcrio/google-samples/k8sdocs:10Then visit http://localhost:4000http://localhost:4000 to see our site Any changes you make on your local machine will be automatically stagedIf youre interested you can view the Dockerfile for this imagehttps://githubcom/kubernetes/kubernetesgithubio/blob/master/staging-container/Dockerfile Staging the site locally from scratch setupThe below commands to setup your environment for running GitHub pages locally Then any edits you make will be viewableon a lightweight webserver that runs on your local machineThis will typically be the fastest way by far to iterate on docs changes and see them staged once you get this set up but it does involve several install steps that take awhile to complete and makes system-wide modificationsInstall Ruby 22 or higher If youre on Linux run these commands:    apt-get install software-properties-common    apt-add-repository ppa:brightbox/ruby-ng    apt-get install ruby22    apt-get install ruby22-dev If youre on a Mac follow these instructionshttps://gorailscom/setup/osx/ If youre on a Windows machine you can use the Ruby Installerhttp://rubyinstallerorg/downloads/ During the installation make sure to check the option for Add Ruby executables to your PATHThe remainder of the steps should work the same across operating systemsTo confirm youve installed Ruby correctly at the command prompt run gem --version and you should get a response with your version number Likewise you can confirm you have Git installed properly by running git --version which will respond with your version of GitInstall the GitHub Pages package which includes Jekyll:gem install github-pagesClone our site:git clone https://githubcom/kubernetes/kubernetesgithubiogitMake any changes you want Then to see your changes locally:cd kubernetesgithubiojekyll serveYour copy of the site will then be viewable at: http://localhost:4000http://localhost:4000or wherever Jekyll tells you GitHub helpIf youre a bit rusty with git/GitHub you might want to readthishttp://readwritecom/2013/10/02/github-for-beginners-part-2 for a refresher Common Tasks Edit Page Titles or Change the Left NavigationEdit the yaml files in /data/ for the Guides Reference Samples or Support areasYou may have to exit and jekyll clean before restarting the jekyll serve toget changes to files in /data/ to show up Add ImagesPut the new image in /images/docs/ if its for the documentation and just /images/ if its for the websiteFor diagrams we greatly prefer SVG files Include code from another fileTo include a file that is hosted on this GitHub repo insert this code:pre123 include codehtml languageltLEXERVALUEgt fileltRELATIVEPATHgt ghlinkltPATHFROMROOTgt 125/pre LEXERVALUE: The language in which the file was written must be a value supported by

relative to root eg /docs/admin/fooyamlTo include a file that is hosted in the external main Kubernetes repo make sure its added to /update-imported-docsshhttps://githubcom/kubernetes/kubernetesgithubio/blob/master/update-imported-docssh and run it so that the file gets downloaded then enter:pre123 include codehtml

the docs eg release-12 pageversion The version of Kubernetes associated with this branch of the docs eg v12 pagedocsbranch The name of the GitHub branch on the Docs/Website repo that you are currently using eg release-11 or masterThis keeps the docs youre editing aligned with the Kubernetes version youre talking about For example if you define a link like so youll never have to worry about it going stale in future doc branches:preView the README herehttp://releasesk8sio/123123pagegithubbranch125125/cluster/addons/READMEmd/preThat of course will send users

PartnersKubernetes partners refers to the companies who contribute to the Kubernetes core codebase and/or extend their platform to support Kubernetes Partners can get their logos added to the partner section of the community pagehttp://k8sio/community by following the below steps and meeting the below logo specifications Partners will also need to have a URL that is specific to integrating with Kubernetes ready this URL will be the destination when the logo is clicked The partner product logo should be a transparent png image centered in a 215x125 px frame look at the existing logos for reference The logo must link to a URL that is specific to integrating with Kubernetes hosted on the partners site The logo should be named product-namelogopng and placed in the /images/communitylogos folder The image reference including the link to the partner URL should be added in communityhtml under div classpartner-logos  /div Please do not change the order of the existing partner images Append your logo to the end of the list Once completed and tested the look and feel submit the pull request Thank youKubernetes thrives on community participation and we really appreciate

customize each ontology pageNote that each md file is the primary source for the metadata for eachontology It may seem odd to mix the markdown in with the yaml but inpractice this works well and is easy to mainpulate using the pythonscript in the util/ directoryThe one piece of visual info in the md is the layout field which is necessary for Jekyll Generation of downstream artefactsOBO admins should periodically    git pull    make    jekyll server     open 127001:4000 in a web browser and spot-check changes    git commit -m regenerated derived files -a    git push origin masterSee the Makefile for details This will have the effect ofregenerating the main ontologies yaml used by external consumers suchas OLS as well as the central OBO library build as well as theGitHub pages configyml file This last step is necessary to updatethe front page RDFThe yaml is all YAML-LD and can compile down to RDF/OWL using a generic translator eg JENA plus our context file Community ContributionsNote that general OBO users are free to edit via the github webinterface and make a pull request They can update their own entriesbut they are also welcome to suggest changes elsewhereOn the live site each page has links to view source and edit source This makes use of githubs builtin editing facilityFor example:  view ontology/uberonmdhttps://githubcom/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundrygithubio/blob/master/ontology/uberonmd   edit ontology/uberonmdhttps://githubcom/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundrygithubio/edit/master/ontology/uberonmd Note that joe randoms cannot just come in and update things Anyone with a github ID can make pull requesthttps://helpgithubcom/articles/using-pull-requests/aka PR It is up to the OBO team whether the PR may be merged or rejectedNote that if you make a syntax error whilst editing then the travischeck will fail Your PR will have a big red X next to it in whichcase the OBO team will not merge your PR Dont worry all you have todo is make further edits to fix the syntax errorTODO: add a quick guide to yaml and the tags we use Central OBO library buildsee also the FAQ entry on thisThe central OBO build runs here:  http://buildberkeleyboporg/job/simple-build-obo-all/It takes as metadata input the yml file from this repository It makesuse of the build objectThe output of this job is a set of obo and owl files deposited in  http://berkeleyboporg/ontologies/Depending on the build configuration this may also make additional files See for example:  http://berkeleyboporg/ontologies/uberon/A  http://berkeleyboporg/ontologies/ URL should never be handed out directly This service exists so that:  Un PURL-registered ontologies will have a fall-through  Registered PURL ontologies that do not want to take charge of either OBO or OWL generation will have a place to 302-redirect toThis job will fail if ontologies marked as infallible fail To debug the full log of the last build can be examined:  https://buildberkeleyboporg/job/simple-build-obo-all/lastBuild/consoleFullLook for the text should not fail Adding newsSimply add a post to the posts/posts/ directory -

Jekyllhttp://jekyllrbcom/ site deployed on GitHubpageshttps://pagesgithubcom/All API documentation submissions are welcome To submit a change fork this repo commit your changes and send us apull requesthttp://helpgithubcom/send-pull-requests/ Setup EnvironmentMost of the content of the developer site is written in a format calledkramdownhttp://kramdowngettalongorg/syntaxhtml which is a flavor of Markdown with some enhanced features like theability to do footnote notations We use Kramdown because the markup is both human readable and convertable in to fullyfledged HTML If theres some functionality you cant implement in Kramdown you can always drop down into HTML as alast resortThough kramdown gives us benefits of readbilty it comes at the cost of requiring a build step to preview the changes tothe site Jekyll handles this nicely by detecting changes to the file system and refreshing automatically To setupJekyll to be able to build and view the site follow the steps below: 1 Install RVM if you dont already have it On OSX brew install rvm or on linux yum install rvm To ensure you have   rvm installed properly run rvm list and ensure that there is a version marked as current2 Clone repository git clone gitgithubcom:okta/oktagithubiogit3 Go into project directory cd oktagithubio4 You maybe told that the version of ruby needed by this project isnt installed follow the given instruction to   install the correct verion of ruby for RVM If you did have to install a new version of ruby re-enter the directory   youre in cd cd oktagithubio then verify that the current gemset youre using is called oktagithubio by   running rvm gemset list This project sepcifies a gemset so that the build of this project isnt affected by global   gems on your system5 Now install gems needed by this project into the projects gemset with gem install bundler and then bundle install   This will essentially read the Gemfile in the root directory and install all packages required to run the site6 Start the site bundle exec jekyll serve --watch8 Visit http://localhost:4000 in your browser9 To stop serving the site hit ctrlc in the terminal Publishing Changes the build processThough github pages do support an automatic build process we use a custom toolbar gem which requires that we build thesite ourselves This means that this git repo contains both the source files of the site and the compiled site files Aswe edit the site we should only make changes to the source files and then rely on the following build process to compileand generate the final site content Important Directories source this is where the source files live If youre editing content or adding assets like images or css they  belong in here docs The output HTML files live in this directory Dont edit this content itll be overwritten with every build site this directory is ignored in github It contains the local version of each of the built files in the site almost everything else most of the other directories in the root are the checked in versions of the built site  These files should not be edited directly Find the corresponding version of the file in the source directory modify  that and then re-run the build Build Steps1 Create a topic branch or your work git checkout -b branchname2 Make changes / additions in source directory3 Compile changes into the site directory bundle exec jekyll serve --watch4 Navigate the site and validate your changes5 Stop Jekyll with ctrlc6 Sync the built site files with the checked-in code with: rsync -av site/ /7 Git commit and push changes to github When ready for review create a pull request and mention the users you want to   review your changes Resolving conflicts with upstreamIf you are making changes in a fork here is how to make a clean Pull Request against upstream:1 sync your forkhttps://helpgithubcom/articles/fork-a-repo/keep-your-fork-synced to https://githubcom/okta/oktagithubio/   The command git remote add upstream gitgithubcom:okta/oktagithubiogit is the key part of this step2 After running git fetch upstream in the guide above run this command to pull down changes from upstream:   git merge -s recursive -X theirs upstream/master Contribution ProcessOkta uses theGitHub Flowhttps://guidesgithubcom/introduction/flow/workflow for contributionsPlease read the linkedGitHub Flowhttps://guidesgithubcom/introduction/flow/document to learn the details of that workflowHere is a high-level overview of the GitHub flow:1  Optional Fork this repository2  Create a branch using the git checkout -b BRANCHNAME command    Replace BRANCHNAME with your branch name3  Add commits to your branch using the git add and git commit -m  commands    Push your commits to your branch with the git push command for    example: git push origin BRANCHNAME4  Open a Pull Request    using the GitHub UIhttps://helpgithubcom/articles/using-pull-requests/5  Discuss and review your code using the GitHub UI6  Once your Pull Request has been reviewed and approved one of the    project owners for this site will merge and deploy your Pull    Request Details for the Add commits step1 Clone repository using git clone - the files are organized in this repository as follows:     The root folder / contains the files served by GitHub     source folder contains the source files     site is still ignored2 Create a branch for your changes using git checkout -b BRANCHNAME to create a branch for your changes3 Make changes under the source directory4 Serve the site locally using the jekyll serve -w command5 Preview using http://locahost:4000 Details for the merge and deploy stepDo the following after accepting a pull request:1 Pull down the latest changes using git pull origin master to pull down the latest changes2 Compile the site locally using the jekyll build command3 rsync files from the site directory to repository root directory / with the rsync -r site/ / command4 Add the updated files using the git add  command5 Commit the updated files using the git commit -m your message here command6 Push to GitHub using git push origin master to push to GitHub Note that GitHub will not compile the site Authoring Guide PagesPages are single purpose html or markdown files1 Create a folder with indexhtml file eg pricing/indexhtml2 Author front matter as follows: ---layout: pagetitle: YOURTITLEcss: CSSFILENAMEcss optional page specific css file---3 Put html or css content under front matter4 Expose link to page in header or elsewhere URL will be the folder   name indexhtml is not necessary eg /pricing Docs1  Create PAGENAMEmd in docs/FOLDERNAME eg docs/api/rest/usersmd2  Filenames are underscore seperated and all lowercase eg mycooldocpagemd3  Author front matter ---layout: docspagetitle: Title Case Name of Page---4  The content under the front matter should not have any h1s -    this will be set by the title property5  All h2s in the content will be rendered as a link in the table    of contents6  Create placement entry in manifest at data/docsyml in    appropriate pages section7  The pages name must match the filename without extension eg usersmd  users8  To create a new section in the manifest section: NAMEOFFOLDERtitle: TITLECASENAMEOFSECTION9  The sections structure should follow the folder names10 The ordering of sections and pages in the manifest determines the order in    which they appear in the leftnav Customers1  Create an indexmd folder in customers/CUSTOMERNAME eg customers/box/indexmd2  Create the images:indeximage:     220px x 165px 144dpi  // image used on index pageheaderimage:   1080px x 220px 144dpi  // title bar image on story pagediagramimage:   694px x npx 144dpi  // information graphic at bottom of story page3  Author front matter indexblurb will be clipped over three lines of textsidebarcopy will be markdownified Newlines sohuld be doubled Authors1  Create an entry in source/data/authorsyml2  Put avatar image in source/assets/img Make sure aspect ratio of image is square Blog Posts1 Create a file in source/posts/ with the form YYYY-mm-dd-the-titlemd2 The header should look something like:---layout: blogposttitle: Productionalizing ActiveMQauthor: oktagenericbloggertags: activemq jvm---3 Supporting images should be placed in source/assets/img and should follow the convetion:   nameofpost-image-nameextension where name of the post doesnt include the md extension This will allow us   to know which images are referenced by which post3 Look at other posts for

Mautichttps://wwwmauticorg/docs/indexhtml the open source marketing automation system Just as the code is open source and available for everyone so is the documentation Everyone is welcome to help make this information better and improve as needed Download as PDFClick herehttps://mauticorg/docs/mauticdocspdf to download these docs as a PDF How to contribute to the docsThis repository is the source code for Gitbookhttps://wwwgitbookcom/ published at wwwmauticorg/docshttps://wwwmauticorg/docs/indexhtml The source code is shared here on GitHub so anyone could contribute to the documentation the same way the programmers do with the actual Mautic code  Why is git used for the documentation- versions Anyone can go back an look how the text looked like- authorship Not only every file but every line has its author- community contributions No need to worry about deleting someone elses work while working on the same documentAlthough some git knowledge is required to clone modify commit and push changes there is a way how to avoid that and edit the files directly in the GitHub web interface If you know git use the workflow you like If not following guide will show you how to contribute easily Edit documents in a browser1 Forkhttps://githubcom/mautic/documentationfork-destination-box this repository under your account so youd have permission to edit2 Select a file to edit The file structure is explained below Now lets edit the READMEmd file to show the principles Click on it3 The content of READMEmd should be visible and the Edit buton the pencil icon above as well Hit it4 The content is written in Markdown markuphttps://daringfireballnet/projects/markdown/ Very simple text based formating5 Make a change to the file For example add to the end This is my first contribution6 When you made a change scroll down and notice the form called Commit changes This is important To save a change you have to describe what youve changed and why Write for example A new line added for testing purposes Do not save yet7 Because the GitHub web interface does not provide all features of git we wont have an easy way to revert our change back to the original state Wed have to create another commit where wed delete the added line That would make a mess in the commit history So instead we create a new branch There is a checkbox for it Create a new branch The branch has to have a name yourusername-patch-1 will be prefilled Lets change it to yourusername-testing Click the Propose file change now8 Ok so the change exists in your repository now To propose the change to the official repository you have to send a pull request PR Youve been redirected to do just that Here you describe your proposed change and click please dont send the testing PRs the Create pull request buttonIf you want to clean after the testing go to the Branches section and delete the testing branch The file structureWeve worked with the READMEmd file in the previous section This file is shown in the home page of a GitHub repository and you are reading its content right now It doesnt have anything to do with the Mautic documentationThe SUMMARYmd file defines the menu of the documentation If youll add a new page to the documentation youll have to also add a new line there defining the title and the link to the file Its pretty straightforward when youll see the current menu itemsThe folders are here to group the topics together Open for example the asset folder Youll see it has its own READMEmd file It is the main content when you click on the Asset menu item The manageassetsmd file is a subitem The media subfolder contains all the images used in the md files LinksOften youll want to make a link into another place of the documentation In Markdown the link looks like this:link titlehttp://examplecomThis will create an external link with absolute URL If you want to create an internal link use the relative URL like this:these steps//plugins/integrationtesthtmlThis will link to plugins/integrationtesthtml on the documentation website created from the md source file ImagesAs noted above the images can be placed in the media subfolders The images probably isnt possible to upload via the GitHub web interface but you can upload them to any public URL and link them from therealternative text herehttp://examplecom/images/applepng Tooltip text hereOr if youd want to display an image already uploaded to the documentation repository you can use relative path:alternative text here/assets/media/assets-newcategorypng Tooltip text

documentationhttps://cfenginecom/docs inmarkdown files If you have a texteditor know how to writemarkdownhttp://daringfireballnet/projects/markdown/syntax andEnglish and would like to contribute to the CFEngine documentation then wedlike to invite you to collaborate hereIf you would like to notify us about incorrect documentation but dont havethe time or the knowledge to make a correction directly here then you canreport the issue in the regular CFEngine bugtrackerhttps://cfenginecom/dev/projects/core  Use the Documentationcategory when you create bugs And of course you can search the bug trackerfor known issues with the documentation and help the community ofCFEngine users by correcting some of them Writing DocumentationThe CFEngine documentation is written in regularmarkdownhttp://daringfireballnet/projects/markdown/syntax with someextensions as documented below Check out thecheatsheethttps://cfenginecom/docs/master/markdown-cheatsheethtmlTo keep the source readable in git and workable with a broad range of toolskeep the line length in paragraphs below 78 charactersIf you dont know git then you can still contribute to the documentationusing the GitHub interface as long as you have a GitHub account Fork thisrepository called the upstream using the GitHub web interface makechanges in your fork and create pull requests so that your changes can bemerged into the upstream repositoryIt is in general advisable to make small commits that are submitted throughpull requests frequently Otherwise any structural changes to documentationcontent can cause merge conflicts that are hard to resolve Documentation Structure StructurePages are organized hierarchically in category/subcategory relationshipscorresponding to the organization of the markdown files in the repositoryThe content of the file    documentation/path/of/categoriesmarkdownwill generate a HTML page    docscfenginecom/version/path-of-categorieshtmlwith equivalent location in the left-hand navigation treeThe documentation generation inserts a link to the source markdown in thefooter of each page META tagsAdditional META tags you should set are:    layout: defaultLeave this as default    title: The TitleThe title of the page Quoting is only necessary if the title contains YAMLkeywords like on    published: truefalsePages that set this tag to false will not be part of the navigation structureThe HTML content will however be generated    tags: list of tags with space all lowercaseKeywords for this page which will be displayed on top of the page and usedwhen generating the tag-pages    reviewed: yyyy-mm-dd    reviewed-by: github-userKeeping track of when a documentation page has last been reviewed    sorting: numberSort order within the parent category Tip: make jumps in 10s so that pagescan be inserted laterMETA tag values will be interpreted literally and cannot contain :  and Image filesImage files are in the same directory as the markdown files that embed themGive files unique names to avoid overwrites in the generated websiteSee Style Guide - Charts and graphsChartsandgraphs for stylerequirements for imagesWarning: It is important for images and other binary files to be marked as abinary file in gitattributes Binary file patterns not specifically markedmay be mangled and corrupted within git LinksTo link to pages within the documentation use the syntax:    Link textPage TitleIf Link text is the title of the target page you can also use this shorthand:    Page TitleTo link to a section within the target page use:    Link textPage TitleSection in PageTo links to sections within the current page you can also skip the page title:    Go to sectionSection in Current PageFor standard URLs and locations to link to see themappinghttps://githubcom/cfengine/documentation-generator/blob/master/referencesmd Automatic linkingThe documentation generator automatically creates links for words in codemarkers if that word exists as a page or section title    See also: attributename functionThis will automatically link to the section or page with titleattributename To make explicit links from code words usecode markers in the link text    See also: attributenamepageattributenameWhen the word is a function mark it as such using :    See also: classifyclassifySection titles of the form     section titleare included in that automatic linking To exclude a section headerfrom that automatic linking use the form     section title no linking which is otherwise equivalent for the markdown rendererTo use keywords in inline code without creating an automatic link usetriple backticks:    The meta parameter to this functionWith single backticks this would link to the documentation of the meta attribute or promise type MacrosThe documentation generator will pre-process the markdown contentbefore passing it to Jekyll for the rendering The pre-processorunderstands and replaces the macros Macros all have the formCFEngineMACROparametersand need to be used as a separate line as the entire line will bereplaced by the pre-processor Quoting policy filesThe following macros read code from a file and inject the text inthat file into the documentation Contol comments in the fileand regular expressions passed to the macros can be used to specifywhich sections of the file should be injectedThe injected lines will be in a CFEngine code block Comment linesie lines starting with  are omitted unless they start with  in which case they interrupt the code block and are renderedas markdown All lines between a lines starting with - and are skippedThe generator searches for filename in the core/examplessubdirectory of WKRDIR CFEngineincludeexamplefilenameInjects the code from filename CFEngineincludesnippetfilename beginrx endrx optionalSearches filename for the first line that matches the regularexpression beginrx and injects all lines as a code block fromthere until the first line that matches endrx If endrx isomitted all lines until the end of the file will be injectedIf the line that matches the regular expression is a comment thenit is excluded from the quote otherwise it is included CFEngineincludemarkdownfilename beginrx endrx optionalSearches filename for the first line that matches the regularexpression beginrx and injects all lines verbatim from thereuntil the first line that matches endrx If endrx is omittedall lines until the end of the file will be injected Documenting Policy Libraries CFEnginelibraryincludefilenameParses the JSON version of the CFEngine policy in filename and generatesdocumentation from itThe generator searches for the library in JSON format in the generated subdirectory ofthe documentation generator filename needs to be provided without fileextensionThe generator parses comments between bundle/bodyprototype declaration and the opening  as doxygen syntax supportingthe following tags:    brief textGenerates the Description section    param attr textIncludes text in the documentation for attribute attr within theArguments section    return textGenerates the Return value statementThe content in text is then rendered as standard markdown and can spanmultiple lines and paragraphs    ignoreThe generator will completely ignore this body or bundle no documentationwill be emittedAll comments before the first doxygen-style tag will be ignored Documenting CFEngine Syntax ElementsThe following macros require the syntax map to be generatedvia cf-promises -s into a file syntaxmapjson within thegenerated subdirectory of the documentation generator CFEnginefunctionprototypearg1 arg2 Renders the prototype of the function that has the same name as thetitle of the current page Parameters arg1 etc are used for the namesof the parameters:    Prototype: titlearg1 arg2     Return type: typeUse this before a Description: section in which the behavior of thefunction as well as the individual parameters are then explained CFEnginefunctionattributesarg1 arg2 Renders a list of attributes for the function that has the same name as thetitle of the current page arg1 etc are used for the parameter names:    Arguments:     arg1: type1 in the range: regex     arg2: type2 one of         option1         option2Links to known keywords are generated automaticallyDocument the individual parameters either directly in the Description:section or as a block after using this macro You cannot use the macro ifindividual options of option-type parameters need detailed explanation CFEnginepromiseattributedefaultRenders the syntax description of the current promise attribute The currentmarkdown needs to comply with the following:The current page title is assumed to be the promise type The current level-3header is assumed to be the attribute name or - if the current promiseattribute is a body type - the name of the body In a body type the currentlevel 4 header is interpreted to be the body attributeExample:    ---    title: promisetype    ---     Attributes     attribute1    CFEnginepromiseattributedefault    This will document attribute1 of promisetype     body     attribute1    CFEnginepromiseattributedefault    This will document attribute1 of bodyThe generated markdown is:    Type: type    Allowed input range: range     option1     option2If a default parameter is provided then a Default value: statementis

CFEngineredirecttargetInjects javascript that redirects the current page to the HTML page for targetwhich needs to be a title or titlesection combination as in regular texttitlesectionlinks Content Style GuideMake sure you follow this style guide to make using CFEngine and thedocumentation a consistent and pleasant experience Writing for the web use subheadings to structure content keep paragraphs short support scanning of pages SpellingCFEngine documentation follows the American spelling PunctuationOxford commaIn punctuation a serial comma also called Oxford comma needs to be placedimmediately before the conjunction often and or or in a series of threeor more termsExample:I would like crackers cheese and garlicThe comma as a separator between compound sentencesUse commata to separate independent clauses when they are joined by any ofthese seven coordinating conjunctions: and but for or nor so yetHowever the comma can be dropped in the following cases: if both independent clauses are quite short especially if the two clauses  are very closely related and even more so if the subject of both clauses is  the same or if only the first clause is quite short especially if the two clauses are  very closely related and even more so if the subject of both clauses is the  samePeriods and spacesThe period ending a sentence should be followed by 1 space EmphasizingWhen referring to technical words such as CFEngine keywords filenames or commandsuse backticks to format that word as code ie monospaced font If the word is aknown word a link will automatically generated see aboveWhen referring to UI elements or interactive functionality use italicTo highlight sections of texts without starting a new header use bold AbbreviationsAs a general note avoiding abbreviations provides better readabilityLatin expressions commonly used in English ie that is eg for example cf compare etc and so forth vsversus et al and others Charts and graphs use clear shapes avoid shadows stick to black white and grey avoid background fill colors on large items Technical reference documentation follow the Policy Style Guidemanuals/policy-stylemarkdown  in examples and code snippets use the appropriate lexer for syntax highlighting via Pygments  Most important are the cf3 lexer as well as bash console  diff shell-session and sql But Jekyll supports  many more lexershttp://pygmentsorg/docs/lexers/ avoid custom color schemes and hand-coded HTML document the example after the example codeThe structure of the technical documentation about CFEngine attributesfunctions etc is as follows: Promise AttributesPromise attributes are documented within the respective promise typess referencepage Level-3 headers are used to start a new attribute if the promise attributerequires a body template then see next section    ----    title: promise-type    ----         Promise Attribute    Description: One line summary    Longer explanation on what it does and why it is useful    over multiple paragraphs if necessary    CFEnginepromiseattributedefault value    More information about special input values    Example:    f3        Some code with        cf3 markers        for syntax highlighting        If the example requires explanation do it here Consider using    CFEngine comments within the code directly to explain Preferably    use the includesnippet macro see above to inject code from an external    cf file that is known to run and produce the expected output    Notes:    Additional information spanning as many paragraphs as necessary but mind    the style guide    See also: relatedattribute attributeotherpageattribute BodiesFor promise attributes with a body type you can start with an example of thatbody type with the most relevant attributes set to self-explanatory values     attribute    Description: One line summary    Longer explanation on what this body template is used for    over multiple paragraphs if necessary    CFEnginepromiseattribute    Example:    cf3    body promiseattribute example           attribute1  value1       attribute2  value2        Start explaining each attribute in the body then using level4-headingsfollowing the style for promise attributes as explained above Examplesshould be a code snippet at this point no need for a complete piece ofrunnable code FunctionsNo header necessary - there is one function per page and the pagestitle is the name of the function    CFEnginefunctionprototypeparameter1 parameters2     Description: Returns something based on parameter1 and parameter2    Longer explanation on what it does and why it is useful then afterwards    Summarize what the function does and reference the most important parameters by    name typical use cases etc    Over multiple paragraphs if necessary    CFEnginefunctionattributesparameter1 parameter2    Explain important attribute values correlations and limitations    Example:    cf3        Some code with        cf3 markers        for syntax highlighting        If the example requires explanation do it here Consider using    CFEngine comments within the code directly to explain and the includesnippet    macro to inject code from an external cf file that is known to work    Notes:    Additional information spanning as many paragraphs as necessary but mind    the style guide    See also: relatedfunction relatedattributeNote: The functionattributes macro will generate a simple enumeration of all attributeswith the types and allowed in put range coming from the syntax map and the names

connection perhaps on the Amtrak or on a plane userake slowThis command is the same as rake but will skip getting metrics from various repositories Running rake on a train can take 500 seconds but changing this to rake slow makes it less than a minute for a full compileIf there are errors please dont mergeIf you receive an error regarding There was a problem getting GitHub Metrics please see the Github personal access token information in the setup instructions aboveInternal Datadog folks: Within 5 minutes of merging to master it will deploy automatically You can see the status in documentation How to add a new integrationIntegrations include information that comes from two different sources The first and main source are the files under content/integrations The second source are the metric csv files under dogweb In order to see the metric tables that appear for some of the integrations you need to create an environment variable called githubpersonaltoken assigned your github personal token you need to have access to dogweb and therefore must be a Datadog employee to see this The table will be brought in automatically by the deploy processThe top of each integration file should include the following frontmatter:    ---    title: Datadog-integration name Integration    integrationtitle: integration name    kind: integration    doclevel: basic    ---If you are writing a lot about the integration change doclevel to complete or just remove the whole line Now write the doc There is no need to update any index menu or sidebars Those are automatically generatedMost integrations start with a heading level of 3 Going forward you should start with 1 But if you do make sure to add the newhlevel attribute to the frontmatter: newhlevel: trueEvery integration should have the following format: OverviewAbsolutely RequiredThe first thing in the Overview should be a representative image for the integration Try to make it as interesting as possible The overview section is required and should be a paragraph or two with some bullets of what is interesting about this integration For example the following comes from the Docker integrationGet metrics from Docker in real time to: Visualize your containers performance Correlate the performance of containers with the applications running insideThere are three ways to setup the Docker integration: install the agent on the host on a single priviledged container and on each individual container InstallationRequired with some exceptionsThe installation section should cover anything that needs to be installed on the agent host For instance in the Docker installation section you learn about installing the agent into a container If there is nothing to install on the agent host this section can be left out To be a complete integration either an installation section or a configuration section must be included ConfigurationRequired with some exceptionsThe configuration section should cover anything that you can configure in the Datadog interface or the agent configuration files In almost every case this section should be included since there is almost always something to configure To be a complete integration either an installation section or a configuration section must be includedAt the end of the configuration section include a link to the example configuration files This should be done by adding  insertexamplelinks This method takes a few optional parameters: conf is the name of the example YAML file minus the extension check is the name of the check file minus the py extension setting either check or conf to none will hide that line includeintro set to false will show only the list minus the sentence at the top normally the integration title in the links will come from the pages frontmatter but setting integration will override that yamlextension will change the extension from example to something else like default Configuration OptionsDescribe each of the options available in the YAML file This will often be the stuff included in the YAML comments remove them from the YAML included in the doc but sometimes you will have to investigate a bit to figure out what the option is for  ValidationRequiredThe validation section should include instructions on how to validate that the integration is successfully working MetricsRequired for integrations that have metricsIf the metrics are listed in the integration under dogweb add an attribute to the frontmatter: gitintegrationtitle: integrationname replacing the integration name with the name of the folder for the integration in the dogweb repoThen add  getmetricsfromgit to the Metrics section This will use your Github Personal Token to grab the metrics from the repo For more information about setting up your Github Personal Token see the Setup sectionsetup above EventsOptionalThis is a newer section If you can describe the events that are part of the integration it should go here TroubleshootingOptionalThe troubleshooting section should include anything that answers a question a user might have about the integration If there is a question that comes up in support about the integration it should be added here How to add a new GuideCreate a markdown file under content/guides Add the following front matter at the top of the file:    ---    title: guide title    kind: guide    listorder: where in the list you want the doc to appear    ---Each guide has a listorder Change the list order number of this doc and any other docs to make sure stuff appears in the right order There is no need to update any index menu or sidebars Those are automatically generated1: http://kramdowngettalongorg/quickrefhtml,0.0,DataDog/documentation,34762.0,17.0,0.0,98.0
