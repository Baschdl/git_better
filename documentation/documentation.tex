\section{Challenge Description}\label{challenge-description}

This years InformatiCup challenge was to classify GitHub repositories
automatically based on given class descriptions and sample data. In this
work we present how we explored the given data, detected relevant
features and built an application that predicts repository labels using
different machine learning algorithms.

\section{Data Exploration}\label{data-exploration}

This section explains how we extended the training data set and how we
explored it using different dimension reduction algorithms and
visualization tools.

\subsection{Data Retrieval}\label{data-retrieval}

The corresponding repository of the challenge includes 30 labeled
repositories and 31 repositories that can be used as validation data. It
wouldn't be possible to train convincing prediction models using only
these provided data sets. To extend the amount of available training
data (and as a first step to reduce overfitting), we used the GitHub
Search API, GitHub Showcases and automated as well as manual Google
searches to retrieve more data. One can find the amount of retrieved,
labeled repositories and their origin in the following table.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}rcl@{}}
\toprule
Amount & Label & Origin\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead

repositories\tabularnewline
82 & DATA & Repositories of Github user `datasets'\tabularnewline

\label{data_sources}
\end{longtable}

Overall, we were able to collect 1412 labeled repositories.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
		\includegraphics[max size={\textwidth}{\textheight}]{graphics/training_data_distribution.png}
	\caption{Training Data Distribution}
	\label{training_data_distribution}
\end{figure}

As one can see in the table \ref{data_sources}, we tried to use key words for automated searching that
are as close to the words that were used to describe the different
classes as possible. Though, it's still possible that the collected
training data is biased as we actively selected repositories by
searching for them. As an extension, an approach that could minimize
this bias would be to randomly select repositories (e.g.~from the
GHTorrent project) and label them manually. For the beginning, however,
we neither had the time nor the manpower to label a large amount of
repositories manually. Since the difficulty to collect data entries of a
certain label differed, we ended up with unbalanced training data. As
the class label distribution affects some classifiers heavily, we
trained the models on randomly undersampled training data.

\subsection{Data Analysis}\label{data-analysis}

To get a better idea of how the relationships between the data entries
look like in a higher dimensional space, we used principal component
analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)
to reduce the complexity of the data to 2D while retaining the principal
components respectively the distances between the data points. The 
figure \ref{t-sne-training-data} visualizes the distribution of the labeled data entries
using t-SNE.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
		\includegraphics[max size={\textwidth}{\textheight}]{graphics/t-sne-training-data.png}
	\caption{Distribution of the labeled data entries using t-SNE}
	\label{t-sne-training-data}
\end{figure}

You can find the complete code to generate the figure in the
\href{https://github.com/WGierke/git_better/blob/master/t-SNE\%20Visualization.ipynb}{t-SNE
Visualization Notebook}. To explore the data interactively and in a
three dimensional reduction you can use the
\href{https://github.com/WGierke/git_better\#usage}{tensorflow embedding
projector setup}. {[}maybe add footnotes{]} One can notice that the
``DOCS'' repositories build a cluster while it seems to be more
complicated to separate the other classes.

We also used t-SNE to visualize the similarity between our retrieved
training data and the given validation data as you can see in figure \ref{t-sne-validation-data}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
		\includegraphics[max size={\textwidth}{\textheight}]{graphics/t-sne-validation-data.png}
	\caption{Distribution of the validation data entries using t-SNE}
	\label{t-sne-validation-data}
\end{figure}

Since the validation data does not form separate clusters or outliers,
we could assume that testing the learned models on the validation data
is a good way to verify how well the models generalize. On the other
side, the validation data only contains roughly 30 data entries which is
not enough to give reliable statements about the model performances.
Furthermore, the fact that the validation data seems to be selected
manually implies that it's also biased. Thus, perfect validation data
would be a lot of randomly selected repositories that have been labeled
manually. The
\href{https://github.com/InformatiCup/InformatiCup2017/tree/master/additional_data_sets}{additional
data sets} from another team could allow us to validate our models
better even if they are also biased. As already mentioned, a perfect
training and validation set would only contain repositories that have
been sampled randomly and labeled manually.

\section{Prediction Model}\label{prediction-model}

When a model fits its training data too well and doesn't learn to
generalize, it's considered to ``overfit''. This can occur if the model
is too complex so it learns the training data by heart instead of
understanding how to solve the given problem in general. To prevent
this, we collected more training data than we already received by the
challenge, we applied regularization to hinder the model becoming too
complex and we used ensemble learning.\\
By collecting more data than already given we created a bigger problem
domain that needs to be understood by the model.\\
Regularization adds a measure of the models complexity to the cost
function that needs to be optimized. Thus, the model does not only try
to solve the given problem but it also tries to do that keeping itself
as simple as possible.\\
Ensemble learning uses multiple trained models to calculate one final
prediction. These models are trained using distinct features so they're
not related to each other. The assumption is that when one model makes a
mistake predicting a label, the other models don't make a mistake in
this situation so the (correct predicted) label of the other models is
returned. To decide which model prediction is the correct one we used
the Majority Rule algorithm. One model was trained on the numerical
features of a repository, one on the description, one on the content of
the readme and one on the source code of each repository.\\
The following chapters will explain how we retrieved and cleaned the
data for each model, how we selected relevant features and how we
developed the prediction model.

\subsection{Training and Test Data
Set}\label{training-and-test-data-set}

To train and evaluate the classifiers, we used a train/test/validation
split.\\
First, the collected training data was splitted in a train and a test
split in a stratified manner. This ensured that the distribution of
class labels was balanced in both splits.\\
The classifiers were then trained on the train split and their accuracy
was evaluated on the test split. To calculate their final quality, we
evaluated them on the validation data.

\subsection{Classification Using Numeric Metadata of
Repositories}\label{classification-using-numeric-metadata-of-repositories}

To develop classifiers based on numeric metadata of repositories, we
used the features explained in table \ref{features}.

\begin{table}[]
\centering
\caption{My caption}
\label{features}
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{|l|X|}
\hline

hasCiConfig            & hasTravisConfig OR hasCircleConfig                                                 \\ \hline
commitsCount           & Number of commits                                                                  \\ \hline
branchesCount          & Number of branches                                                                 \\ \hline
tagsCount              & Number of tags                                                                     \\ \hline
releasesCount          & Number of releases                                                                 \\ \hline
LANGUAGE\_*            & How much code was written in the language in percent (e.g. LANGUAGE\_Python, ...)? \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

Most of the features were available using the GitHub API. We added the
\emph{isOwnerHomepage} and \emph{hasHomepage} features to detect whether
a repository serves its source code using GitHub pages. This could allow
us to identify WEB repositories easier. We furthermore hoped that using
\emph{hasCiConfig}, so whether a repo contains a configuration file for
a Continuous Integration service, would improve the accuracy of
detecting DEV repositories.

\subsubsection{Data Cleaning and
Preprocessing}\label{data-cleaning-and-preprocessing}

Using the GitHub REST API and the GitHub GraphQL API, we were able to
receive all features without extensive cleaning or preprocessing of the
data.

\subsubsection{Feature Selection}\label{feature-selection}

Feature Selection describes the process of dropping features that yield
no or very little additional information in order to decrease
overfitting and accelerate model fitting. Especially the programming
language features needed to be reduced using Feature Selection.\\
GitHub detects
\href{https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml}{over
300 used programming languages} in repositories. The problem is that a
lot of them are used only in a few repositories such that there are a
lot of features that only hold very little variance and information. As
an example, among the collected 1400 repositories there were 46
programming languages, like Pony or KiCad, that were only used in one
repository at all. To remove those, we dropped features with low
standard deviation and a low overall sum. As an example, we are already
able to drop 135 language features if we require that the sum of a
language feature over all 1400 training data entries is supposed to be
bigger than 5.

\subsubsection{Feature Engineering}\label{feature-engineering}

In a next step, we derived further features from the features we already
collected. We used polynomial feature generation which takes the input
variables and builds all possible polynomial combination of this
features up to a given degree. The idea of taking input features and
applying a non-linear method on it to map the original values in another
space is called ``kernel trick'' and is used by Support Vector Machines
(SVM) to learn non-linear models as well.\\
As an example, suppose a dataset is given with the two features
\emph{size} and \emph{watchers} as in table \ref{example-feature-engineering-basic}.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cc@{}}
%\label{example-feature-engineering-basic}
\toprule
size & watchers\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
2 & 5\tabularnewline
10 & 8\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

The transformed dataset using polynomial features with a degree up to 2
would look like table \ref{example-feature-engineering-transformed}.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ccccc@{}}
%\label{example-feature-engineering-transformed}
\toprule
size¹ & watchers¹ & size¹xwatchers¹ & size² & watchers²\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
2 & 5 & 10 & 4 & 25\tabularnewline
10 & 8 & 80 & 100 & 64\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

As one can see, the number of generated features increases polynomially
in the number of input features. That's why the previous Feature
Selection step was very important.

As alternative we could have used deep learning techniques but you need
many training samples because of their higher learning complexity. Our
\textasciitilde{}1500 samples aren't enough for this. Small feed-forward
neural networks are applicable to our problem while deep neural networks
are not.

\subsubsection{Numeric Metadata Prediction
Model}\label{numeric-metadata-prediction-model}

We tried the following classifiers: \ldots{}

{[}Better without language features{]}

{[}accuracy from single models{]}{[}accuracy from ensembled models{]}

\subsubsection{Validation of Prediction
Model}\label{validation-of-prediction-model}

{[}accuracy+confusion matrix{]}

\subsection{Classification Using Text Data (Description and
Readme)}\label{classification-using-text-data-description-and-readme}

Intuitively, one wouldn't use the numeric features like the number of
branches etc. to decide what label fits the repository best. Instead,
one would use the description or the content of the readme to determine
it. For this reason we used term frequency--inverse document frequency
(tf-idf) matrices to develop natural language processing (NLP) models
that predict the label based on them. Since there's a semantic
difference between the description and the readme of a repository, we
discarded the idea of concatenating the text features and training one
model on it. Instead, we trained two seperate models on the description
respectively readme of the repositories.

\subsubsection{Data Cleaning and
Preprocessing}\label{data-cleaning-and-preprocessing-1}

To remove words like `the', `a', `and' etc. that occur very often and
yield little meaning, we used the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to
drop English stopwords. Since it's also not important whether the
singular or the plural of words are used, we also used this toolkit to
stem English words.

\subsubsection{Feature Generation from Existing
Data}\label{feature-generation-from-existing-data}

We used a count vectorizer which converts a text into a n-dimensional
vector representing the vocabulary, where n is the number of unique
words. After this text-to-vector conversion we transformed the vector
into a tf-idf vector which is a normalized representation of the
original vector.

\subsubsection{Feature Selection}\label{feature-selection-1}

{[}removal of rare/frequent words and stopwords{]}

\subsubsection{Prediction Model}\label{prediction-model-1}

Based on our tf-idf vector we can classify the different repositories
using the n-dimensional vector as features and normal classification
algorithms.

\subsubsection{Validation of Prediction
Model}\label{validation-of-prediction-model-1}

		\includegraphics[max size={\textwidth}{\textheight}]{graphics/confusion-matrix-readme-classifier.png}

	\caption{Description Classifier: 48.4\% Accuracy on Validation Data}
	\label{confusion-matrix-description-classifier}
\end{figure}

{[}Include images with additional validation data{]}

\subsection{Classification Using Source
Code}\label{classification-using-source-code}

We tested different approaches to use the source code and connected data
of a repository to classify it. For this task we used only data included
in the git repository, no github specific data like projects, the wiki
pages\ldots{} Data from the repositories are including source code files
with comments and git workflow specific data (branches,
commits\ldots{}). We used in this chapter mainly the source code, file
names and commit messages.

\subsubsection{Data Cleaning and
Preprocessing}\label{data-cleaning-and-preprocessing-2}

We cloned each repository locally to retrieve the data we need. After
this step we were able to merge all non-binary source code files, all
filenames and all git commit messages into three different files. We
didn't filter based on languages and all UTF-8 files are included. This
could be an additional preprocessing step to improve and simplify the
stemming and classification.

\subsubsection{Feature Generation from Existing
Data}\label{feature-generation-from-existing-data-1}

We were able to use the same feature generation approach based on the
count vectorizer and tf-idf vector as used in the text data
classification.
\href{https://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/papers/KDD-2002-whatsthecode.pdf}{Ugurel
et al.} showed a similar approach successfully.

\subsubsection{Feature Selection}\label{feature-selection-2}

{[}removal of rare/frequent words and stopwords{]}

\subsubsection{Prediction Model}\label{prediction-model-2}

{[}Same as text data{]}

\subsubsection{Validation of Prediction
Model}\label{validation-of-prediction-model-2}

{[}accuracy+confusion matrix{]}

\end{itemize}

\section{Implemented Application}\label{implemented-application}

Our implemented application takes a file containing GitHub repository
URLs, classifies them using an ensemble model that's trained on passed
training data and saves the URLs and their computed labels on the disk.
If no training data is given, the input data will be classified using
our pre-trained model. It's possible to pass the input data, which is
supposed to have the format of the
\href{https://github.com/InformatiCup/InformatiCup2017/blob/master/example-input}{challenge
example}, using the \texttt{-i} argument. Optional training data can be
passed using the \texttt{-t} argument.\\
As an example, to classify the example data given by the challenge using
the training data given by the challenge one would run: ~

\texttt{python\ app/main.py\ -i\ data/example-input.txt\ -t\ data/training\_data\_small.csv}

The saved output file \texttt{predictions.txt} will have the format of
the
\href{https://github.com/InformatiCup/InformatiCup2017/blob/master/example-output}{challenge
example}.\\
For setup instructions please refer to the README.md file.

\section{Validation}\label{validation}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  {[}boolean(!) matrix on validation data{]}
\item
  {[}compute recall and precision{]}
\item
  {[}discuss quality of results and whether higher yield or higher
  precision is more important{]}
\item
  {[}(elaborate on the additional dataset given by another team?){]}
\end{itemize}

\section{Extensions}\label{extensions}

To bring our research work to production, we built a
\href{https://git-better.herokuapp.com/}{service} that classifies your
public GitHub repositories using models that were trained on our
training data. The server uses GitHub OAuth to authenticate GitHub users
and uses their OAuth tokens to request their public repositories and
their necessary features. We're planning to improve the design with
visualizations of the repository distribution using D3.\\
Another extension would be to recommend
\href{https://github.com/trending}{trending GitHub projects} based on
the public repositories of the user.\\
Since there is no official GitHub API for the trending repositories, we
would crawl all websites that are available at
https://github.com/trending/\{language\}?since=\{since\} once a day,
where \emph{language} is a supported programming language like Python or
Ruby, and \emph{since} is one of `daily', `weekly' or `monthly'. We
would then recommend repositories to the user based on their classified
labels, on the preferred language of the user, on the text or even code
similarity between the trending projects and those of the user. To
implement the latter one, we could use tf-idf matrices like we already
used for the text classifiers.
