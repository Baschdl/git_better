Boot makes it easy to create Spring-powered production-grade applications andservices with absolute minimum fuss It takes an opinionated view of the Spring platformso that new and existing users can quickly get to the bits they needYou can use Spring Boot to create stand-alone Java applications that can be started usingjava -jar or more traditional WAR deployments We also provide a command line toolthat runs spring scriptsOur primary goals are: Provide a radically faster and widely accessible getting started experience for allSpring development Be opinionated out of the box but get out of the way quickly as requirements start todiverge from the defaults Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projectseg embedded servers security metrics health checks externalized configuration Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration Installation and Getting StartedThe docs/htmlsingle/reference documentation includes detaileddocs/htmlsingle/getting-started-installing-spring-bootinstallation instructionsas well as a comprehensive docs/htmlsingle/getting-started-first-applicationgettingstarted guide Documentation is published in docs/htmlsingle/HTMLdocs/pdf/spring-boot-referencepdfPDF and docs/epub/spring-boot-referenceepubEPUBformatsHere is a quick teaser of a complete Spring Boot application in

Check the docs/htmlsingle/reference documentation especially the  docs/htmlsingle/howtoHow-tos -- they provide solutions to the most common  questions Learn the Spring basics -- Spring Boot builds on many other Spring projects check  the http://springiospringio web-site for a wealth of reference documentation If  you are just starting out with Spring try one of the http://springio/guidesguides Ask a question - we monitor http://stackoverflowcomstackoverflowcom for questions  tagged with http://stackoverflowcom/tags/spring-bootspring-boot Report bugs with Spring Boot at https://githubcom/spring-projects/spring-boot/issuesgithubcom/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues Reporting IssuesSpring Boot uses GitHubs integrated issue tracking system to record bugs and featurerequests If you want to raise an issue please follow the recommendations below: Before you log a bug please https://githubcom/spring-projects/spring-boot/searchtypeIssuessearch the issue tracker  to see if someone has already reported the problem If the issue doesnt already exist https://githubcom/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/newcreate a new issue Please provide as much information as possible with the issue report we like to know  the version of Spring Boot that you are using as well as your Operating System and  JVM version If you need to paste code or include a stack trace use Markdown  escapes  before and after your text If possible try to create a test-case or project that replicates the issue You can  submit sample projects as pull-requests against the  https://githubcom/spring-projects/spring-boot-issuesspring-boot-issues GitHub  project Use the issue number for the name of your project Building from SourceYou dont need to build from source to use Spring Boot binaries inhttp://repospringiorepospringio but if you want to try out the latest andgreatest Spring Boot can be easily built with thehttps://githubcom/takari/maven-wrappermaven wrapper You also need JDK 18 althoughBoot applications can run on Java 16indent0---- /mvnw clean install----If you want to build with the regular mvn command you will needhttp://mavenapacheorg/run-maven/indexhtmlMaven v321 or aboveNOTE: You may need to increase the amount of memory available to Maven by settinga MAVENOPTS environment variable with the value -Xmx512m Rememberto set the corresponding property in your IDE as well if you are building and runningtests there eg in Eclipse go to Preferences-Java-Installed JREs and edit theJRE definition so that all processes are launched with those arguments This propertyis automatically set if you use the maven wrapperAlso see link:CONTRIBUTINGadocCONTRIBUTINGadoc if you wish to submit pull requestsand in particular please fill out thehttps://supportspringsourcecom/springcommittersignupContributors Agreementbefore your first change however trivial Or if you filed such an agreement already foranother project just mention that in your pull request Building reference documentationThe reference documentation requires the documentation of the Maven plugin to beavailable so you need to build that first since its not generated by defaultindent0---- /mvnw clean install -pl spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-maven-plugin -Pdefaultfull----The documentation also includes auto-generated information about the starters Toallow this information to be collected the starter projects must be built first:indent0---- /mvnw clean install -f spring-boot-starters----Once this is done you can build the reference documentation with the command below:indent0---- /mvnw clean prepare-package -pl spring-boot-docs -Pdefaultfull----TIP: The generated documentation is available from spring-boot-docs/target/contents/reference ModulesThere are a number of modules in Spring Boot here is a quick overview: spring-bootThe main library providing features that support the other parts of Spring Bootthese include: The SpringApplication class providing static convenience methods that make it easyto write a stand-alone Spring Application Its sole job is to create and refresh anappropriate Spring ApplicationContext Embedded web applications with a choice of container Tomcat or Jetty for now First class externalized configuration support Convenience ApplicationContext initializers including support for sensible loggingdefaults spring-boot-autoconfigureSpring Boot can configure large parts of common applications based on the contentof their classpath A single EnableAutoConfiguration annotation triggersauto-configuration of the Spring contextAuto-configuration attempts to deduce which beans a user might need For example IfHSQLDB is on the classpath and the user has not configured any database connectionsthen they probably want an in-memory database to be defined Auto-configuration willalways back away as the user starts to define their own beans spring-boot-startersStarters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include inyour application You get a one-stop-shop for all the Spring and related technologythat you need without having to hunt through sample code and copy paste loads ofdependency descriptors For example if you want to get started using Spring and JPA fordatabase access just include the spring-boot-starter-data-jpa dependency in yourproject and you are good to go spring-boot-cliThe Spring command line application compiles and runs Groovy source making it supereasy to write the absolute minimum of code to get an application running Spring CLIcan also watch files automatically recompiling and restarting when they change spring-boot-actuatorSpring Boot Actuator provides additional auto-configuration to decorate your applicationwith features that make it instantly deployable and supportable in production  Forinstance if you are writing a JSON web service then it will provide a server securitylogging externalized configuration management endpoints an audit abstraction andmore If you want to switch off the built in features or extend or replace them itmakes that really easy as well spring-boot-loaderSpring Boot Loader provides the secret sauce that allows you to build a single jar filethat can be launched using java -jar Generally you will not need to usespring-boot-loader directly but instead work with thelink:spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-gradle-pluginGradle orlink:spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-maven-pluginMaven plugin SamplesGroovy samples for use with the command line application are available inlink:spring-boot-cli/samplesspring-boot-cli/samples To run the CLI samples typespring run samplegroovy from samples directoryJava samples are available in link:spring-boot-samplesspring-boot-samples and shouldbe built with maven and run by invoking java -jar target/samplejar GuidesThe http://springio/springio site contains several guides that show how to use SpringBoot step-by-step: http://springio/guides/gs/spring-boot/Building an Application with Spring Boot is a  very basic guide that shows you how to create a simple application run it and add some  management services http://springio/guides/gs/actuator-service/Building a RESTful Web Service with Spring  Boot Actuator is a guide to creating a REST web service and also shows how the server  can be configured http://springio/guides/gs/convert-jar-to-war/Converting a Spring Boot JAR Application  to a WAR shows you how to run applications in a web server as a WAR file
